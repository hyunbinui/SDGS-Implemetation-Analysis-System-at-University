Water Stewardship Programme
NUI Galway is committed to the effective and
efficient use of water throughout the campus
and the appropriate treatment, management
and disposal of wastewater. We are striving
to reduce our water usage and increase the
use of harvested rainwater through a series of
measures, including: water leakage detection
and repair programme, education and outreach,
process-related efficiency measures, greywater
and rainwater harvesting. As a participant in
the Water Stewardship Programme, we are
working in conjunction with Irish Water to
lower our water use and operating costs while
protecting the environment. The Sustainable
Water Partner badge demonstrates that key
staff have undertaken a course designed
to show leadership and set goals/targets in
reducing water consumption. Our NUI Galway
Water Stewardship Charter sets out our
commitment to maintain and achieve further
reductions in water usage on campus and to
highlight the importance of water as a critical
and limited resource. The Charter and our NUI
Galway Sustainability Strategy sets out our
commitment to reduce water usage on campus

Water-efficient Building Design
Water-efficient building designs are a critical part in making water management
a reality. Our buildings are designed in consideration of Taiwan's green building
certification system (EEWH). We've improved the three major indicators of soil-water
retention, water resources, and garbage & sewage improvement to ensure that the
building can retain water and thereby prevent floods. Water-efficient hardware has been
installed and we recycle rainwater and reclaimed water to become more water-efficient.
Separate systems for rainwater and wastewater can also help increase the reuse value
of rainwater and reduce wastewater treatment load. The University currently has two
outsourced projects under construction: The General Activities Building and Student
Dormitory (both temporary names). They will respectively receive a Silver Level and
Qualified Level according to the EEWH certification system upon completion",Water Conversation on Campus, 캠퍼스에서의 물 대화,6,2

Researchers have developed a powerful, low-cost method

Waste cooking oil currently has to go through an energy-intensive
cleaning process to be used in biodiesel, because commercial
production methods can only handle pure feedstocks with
1-2% contaminants. The new catalyst is so tough it can make
biodiesel from low-grade ingredients, known as feedstock,

526,뉴질랜드,Auckland,"Coastal erosion / One of the most recognised hazards for the coastal communities inNew Zealand is coastal erosion, which leads to shoreline cliffs recedingand threatening homes. Award-winning research by Dr CatrionaThompson reveals that it is a particular type of wave that has the biggestimpact on coastal cliffs, and not necessarily the highest. Measuring thewaves and their impact, Catriona concluded that the impact of a wavethat breaks against the cliff was significantly greater than either brokenor unbroken waves. The study is the first to look at coastal erosion bymeasuring ground motion at the seismic level while also recording theimpact of individual waves. It shows that sea-level rise is likely to havetwo different effects: in areas where there is a significant rise in sea level,sea height could increase the number of breaking waves while in otherareas it might mean a higher number of unbroken waves, which coulddecrease erosion rates. The study has been recognised by the BritishSociety for Geomorphology which has awarded it the Michael KirkbyAward (previously known as the Wiley Award) for best paper published atEarth Surface Processes and Landforms in 2019.",A PhD student at the University of Auckland has found that breaking waves are more likely to cause coastal erosion than unbroken waves., 오클랜드 대학교의 박사 과정 학생은 부서지는 파도가 부서지지 않은 파도보다 해안 침식을 일으킬 가능성이 더 높다는 것을 발견했습니다.,14,2

the supply chain
Globally, coffee is grown by more than 25 million farmers
across 60 countries and is a highly traded global commodity,
with approx. 9.66 billion kg consumed annually. Coffee is
grown in some of the most biodiverse areas of the world and
while coffee benefits from increased biodiversity, its production
is also a driver of biodiversity loss. Biodiverse shade-grown
coffee, as opposed to sun-grown coffee, is intended to be
better for biodiversity (e.g. through primary forest restrictions;
canopy habitat protection; proper disposal of waste products).
Mainstreaming shade-grown coffee is key for the industry to
mitigate risk from climate change and environmental degradation.
In an ongoing research project funded by the Australian
Research Council, Zoos Victoria and Melbourne-based
Genovese Coffee, members of the Interdisciplinary Conservation
Science Research (ICON Science) group at RMIT are examining
the structural and behavioural barriers to increased biodiversityfriendly
production, retail and consumption, and exploring how
to overcome these barriers with behavioural interventions. Initial
work for this project has provided insights into current levels
of concern and awareness of coffee production’s negative
impacts on biodiversity among Melbourne coffee consumers.
And using behavioural nudges has tested the efficacy of different
types of messages to increase the likelihood that an individual
will purchase biodiversity-friendly coffee.
The next steps for this project include examining motivations
and barriers among coffee growers in Brazil and Indonesia to
participate in shade-grown coffee production and evaluating
Zoos Victoria’s coffee behaviour change campaign. It is hoped
that this research will make high-quality shade-grown coffee
available to the Melbourne market and beyond whilst achieving
equitable outcomes for producers and biodiversity.",How do we make high-quality shade-grown coffee available to the Melbourne market and beyond whilst achieving equitable outcomes for producers and biodiversity?, 생산자와 생물다양성을 위해 공평한 결과를 달성하면서 고품질의 그늘에서 재배된 커피를 멜버른 시장과 그 너머에 제공하려면 어떻게 해야 합니까?,15,2
