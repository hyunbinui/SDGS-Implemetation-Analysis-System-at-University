As anexample, Professor Grant Covic and a team from the Faculty ofEngineering have been awarded $13.5 million by the Ministry ofBusiness, Innovation and Employment to research wireless chargingtechnologies for heavy freight vehicles. The ability to charge freightvehicles using wireless technologies is significant, because it removestwo of the largest barriers to freight operators adopting electricvehicles: the time it takes to charge them, and the weight of thebattery packs. Professor Covic collaborates with other engineeringspecialists, including Professor Simon Bickerton who works on themechanical aspects, and Dr Doug Wilson who addresses paving andtransport engineering questions.

help manage their electricity bills, reduce their environmental impact
and help stabilise the grid, yet are often presented with overly
complicated processes that can discourage them from pursuing
opportunities to participate in the energy market. The study revealed
Australians eager to shift to clean technologies like solar are keen on
platforms similar to Airbnb or Uber that would enable them to trade
and share their excess power. It found that research participants,
regardless of political or environmental persuasions, were keen to
embrace new energy technologies and also want those who can’t
afford solar, or aren’t allowed to install it themselves, to benefit. The
research found that households already consider feeding electricity
into the grid for collective use as a form of sharing energy with
other households – but that they want to be confident their homegenerated,
clean electricity benefits people who need it, rather than
boosting energy company profits.","Australians are keen to share their excess solar power with others, according to a new study.", 새로운 연구에 따르면 호주인들은 과잉 태양열 발전을 다른 사람들과 공유하기를 열망하고 있습니다.,7,3

The University of Texas at Dallas is leading in several areas of renewable energy research. In 2019, a research team led by Dr. Babak Fahimi developed a generator prototype that uses liquid metal to convert waste heat into clean electricity. Fahimi shared that “heat is an abundant renewable energy source. In data centers, for example, we spend a lot of time getting rid of the heat by using chillers and air conditioning. Our work focuses on recycling that heat back to electricity.”
