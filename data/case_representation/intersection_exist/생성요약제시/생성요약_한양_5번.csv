To raise standards of medical education globally and encourage more clinicians to build careers within the healthcare systems

“We are working with partner institutions across the globe
to adapt elements of UCL’s internationally recognised medical programmes and tailor them to make them relevant to different local cultural, ethical and regulatory contexts,” explains Dr Ahmed Rashid, who leads the UCL Medical School Education Consultancy Unit.
In one partnership, UCL academics worked with colleagues at
New Giza University, Egypt, to devise modern and innovative undergraduate medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy programmes, to
be taught in Egypt. They used established materials, assessments and processes from the equivalent programmes at UCL as the programme’s basis, and adapted them to Egyptian sociocultural, ethical, professional and regulatory frameworks. Dr Rashid’s research with students and educators in
partner institutions has identified challenges such as language barriers and differing sociocultural traditions, which have been overcome by working with local education leaders to develop personalised programmes that fit the local context.
“These adaptations help to
ensure graduates develop a
sense of social responsibility and an understanding of local health challenges, making it more likely that they will stay in the healthcare system in their home country, where they are needed most,” explains Dr Rashid.","To raise standards of medical education globally and encourage more clinicians to build careers within the healthcare systems in their home countries, staff in the UCL Medical School are collaborating with medical educators to support teaching programmes around the world.", 전 세계적으로 의학 교육의 표준을 높이고 더 많은 임상의가 본국의 의료 시스템 내에서 경력을 쌓도록 장려하기 위해 UCL 의과 대학의 직원은 의료 교육자와 협력하여 전 세계의 교육 프로그램을 지원하고 있습니다.,17,5

As part of the university's development plan, THU is committed to promoting the
teaching and research of economic, social, ecological, and cultural sustainability. To
such ends, THU will be curating an interdisciplinary faculty and establishing research
centers and 4 interdisciplinary, innovative virtual colleges to advance SDG education.
For example, THU started offering a wide range of courses in 2019 that corresponded
to specific SDG topics. Students could progress through introductory courses, midlevel
core courses, and advanced seminar courses to gradually recognize and realize
the real problems that SDGs are meant to tackle. Most advanced classes will have
corresponding practicum sites (e.g. THU Farmer's Market, Red Land Farm, East Creek,
THU Lake, Gaomei Wetlands Wildlife Refuge, etc.). In terms of educating students and
raising awareness on SDGs, the Center for General Education will be offering general
