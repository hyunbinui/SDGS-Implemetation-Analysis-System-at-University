Australia loses about 35,000 gigalitres

volatile water resources, measuring
the water footprint of products is

New research, led by RMIT in collaboration with researchers
and clinicians from across Ireland and Australia, helps explain
why flu can lead to life-threatening complications during
pregnancy, suggesting the virus does not stay in the lungs but
spreads throughout the mother’s body. The pre-clinical study has
overturned current scientific thinking surrounding the reasons
why flu infections affect pregnant women and their babies so
severely.
The findings could also help researchers working to understand
the fundamental biology of how COVID-19, another respiratory
disease, spreads from the lungs into the body. Research in
animal models showed that during pregnancy flu spreads from
the lungs through the blood vessels into the circulatory system,
triggering a damaging hyperactive immune response. Lead
author Dr Stella Liong said the research suggests the vascular
system is at the heart of potentially devastating complications
caused by influenza during pregnancy. She also stated that
conventional thinking blamed the suppressed immune system
that occurs in pregnancy, but the research found the opposite
effect – flu infection leads to a drastically heightened immune
