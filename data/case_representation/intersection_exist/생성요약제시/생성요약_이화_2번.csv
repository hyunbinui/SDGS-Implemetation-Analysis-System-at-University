511,뉴질랜드,Auckland,"Interrupting biofouling / University of Auckland bioengineers have developed an innovative wayto get rid of the underwater biofouling that creates such a headache formarinas, boat owners and aqua farmers. Electroclear, a new spin-outcompany based at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute (ABI), is usingelectric fields to disrupt small organisms’ ability to live on selectedunderwater surfaces. Christopher Walker and fellow doctoral studentand company partner Patrin Illenberger, brought their bioengineeringtraining to bear on the problem. It is a permanent, non-toxic solutionthat can be applied to a wide range of geometries. They discoveredthat if they set up two separate electrodes underwater and created afully encapsulated electric field, they could target and disrupt certainorganisms. “As an island nation with such strong ties to our ocean, wehave a real chance here to lead the world in anti-fouling and biosecurity,”says Christopher.

314,호주,RMIT,"3. Making biodiesel from dirty old cooking oil
Researchers have developed a powerful, low-cost method
for recycling used cooking oil and agricultural waste into
biodiesel, and turning food scraps and plastic rubbish into
high-value products. The method harnesses a new type of ultraefficient
catalyst that can make low-carbon biodiesel and other
valuable complex molecules out of diverse, impure raw materials.
Waste cooking oil currently has to go through an energy-intensive
cleaning process to be used in biodiesel, because commercial
production methods can only handle pure feedstocks with
1-2% contaminants. The new catalyst is so tough it can make
biodiesel from low-grade ingredients, known as feedstock,
containing up to 50% contaminants.
It is so efficient it could double the productivity of manufacturing
processes for transforming rubbish like food scraps,
microplastics and old tyres into high-value chemical precursors

【Abstract】
As the number of natural disasters such as fl oods and landslides increases with the
progress of climate change, it is becoming more and more important to develop
infrastructure for disaster prevention and mitigation. Against this backdrop, green
infrastructure, which utilize the functions of nature to cope with such disasters, has
been attracting attention. Green infrastructure not only has a smaller impact on
ecosystems and landscapes than artifi cial infrastructure (gray infrastructure) such
as dams, but is often less expensive to build and to maintain in the future. I study
the cost-effectiveness of the so-called “ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction:
Eco-DRR” that utilizes green infrastructure from an economic perspectiv e.
【Future prospects】
My research focuses on flood control using forests and retarding basin against
river fl ooding caused by heavy rainfall due to climate change. I plan to expand my
research to include green infrastructure against a wider range of natural disasters.

Professor Chunjiang An has been awarded over $5 million
from Fisheries and Oceans Canada for projects focused on
improving oil-spill cleanup processes. One project will develop
ways to decrease environmental risks during oil-spill cleanups
by accelerating degradation and removal of the pollutant, while
the second will help fill the gap between the available surface
washing techniques and the increasing application need.",Researchers at the University of Calgary have been awarded over $5 million from Fisheries and Oceans Canada for projects focused on improving oil-spill cleanup processes.
