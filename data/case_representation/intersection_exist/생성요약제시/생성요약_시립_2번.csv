Researchers have developed a powerful, low-cost method
for recycling used cooking oil and agricultural waste into
biodiesel, and turning food scraps and plastic rubbish into
high-value products. The method harnesses a new type of ultraefficient
catalyst that can make low-carbon biodiesel and other
valuable complex molecules out of diverse, impure raw materials.
Waste cooking oil currently has to go through an energy-intensive
cleaning process to be used in biodiesel, because commercial
production methods can only handle pure feedstocks with
1-2% contaminants. The new catalyst is so tough it can make
biodiesel from low-grade ingredients, known as feedstock,
containing up to 50% contaminants.
It is so efficient it could double the productivity of manufacturing
processes for transforming rubbish like food scraps,
microplastics and old tyres into high-value chemical precursors
used to make anything from medicines and fertilisers to
biodegradable packaging.","Researchers have developed a powerful, low-cost method for recycling used cooking oil and agricultural waste into biodiesel, and turning food scraps and plastic rubbish into high-value products.", 연구원들은 사용한 식용유와 농업 폐기물을 바이오디젤로 재활용하고 음식물 찌꺼기와 플라스틱 쓰레기를 고부가가치 제품으로 바꾸는 강력하고 저렴한 방법을 개발했습니다.,12,2

Thisincludes managing the threat posed by waste, as well as exploring opportunities tocreate value from waste.

Globally, coffee is grown by more than 25 million farmers
across 60 countries and is a highly traded global commodity,
with approx. 9.66 billion kg consumed annually. Coffee is
grown in some of the most biodiverse areas of the world and
while coffee benefits from increased biodiversity, its production
is also a driver of biodiversity loss. Biodiverse shade-grown
coffee, as opposed to sun-grown coffee, is intended to be
better for biodiversity (e.g. through primary forest restrictions;
canopy habitat protection; proper disposal of waste products).
Mainstreaming shade-grown coffee is key for the industry to
mitigate risk from climate change and environmental degradation.
In an ongoing research project funded by the Australian
Research Council, Zoos Victoria and Melbourne-based

the structural and behavioural barriers to increased biodiversityfriendly
production, retail and consumption, and exploring how
to overcome these barriers with behavioural interventions. Initial

impacts on biodiversity among Melbourne coffee consumers.
And using behavioural nudges has tested the efficacy of different
types of messages to increase the likelihood that an individual
will purchase biodiversity-friendly coffee.

providing vital habitats for millions of species and important sources for clean air and water; as
well as being crucial for combating climate change.
Today we are seeing unprecedented land degradation, and the loss of arable land at 30 to 35
times the historical rate. Drought and desertification is also on the rise each year, amounting to
the loss of 12 million hectares and affects poor communities globally. Of the 8,300 animal breeds
known, 8 percent are extinct and 22 percent are at risk of extinction.
About 80% of the Arab region is made up of dryland ecosystems, particularly fragile with
converging risks from climate change. Threatened species in the region stand at over 1,000, with
a majority being critically endangered. Of these, 24% are fish, 22% birds and 20% mammals. Arab
countries have made efforts to preserve their biodiversity, including through the expansion of
protected areas and sustainable use regimes in key ecosystems such as oases. As a percentage
of total territorial area, protected areas grew from 3.21% in 1990 to 9.28% in 2012.
The SDGs aim to conserve and restore the use of terrestrial ecosystems such as forests, wetlands,
drylands and mountains by 2020. Halting deforestation is also vital to mitigating the impact

In 2020, the RMIT Centre for Urban Research was awarded
an Australian Research Council (ARC) grant to undertake
the Onsets not offsets for real biodiversity gains project.
This ARC Discovery Project addresses the profound challenge
of reconciling development and biodiversity conservation by
developing an alternative to the pervasive, yet unsuccessful,
biodiversity offsetting approach.
A key outcome of the project will be a new framework for
biodiversity onsetting, tested against environmental and social
feasibility metrics, and new biodiversity evaluation methods for
novel habitats. The project will deliver tangible environmental
benefits with a substantial legacy. The shift away from off-site,
future biodiversity gains and towards on-site gains will assist
Australia’s ability to meet international obligations, by slowing
the decline of biodiversity associated with urban development
and agriculture and providing new opportunities for habitats
and resources in highly modified landscapes. It will provide a
framework for truly sustainable development which, at its heart,
aims to reconcile economic development, human wellbeing
and environmental outcomes in a balanced way.

development. Australia has been a world leader in the
development of offset policies, but now must lead the way

For Small Island Developing States, addressing development challenges while planning for climate change is a constant struggle. Kiribati is a low-- lying island nation in the Pacific Ocean, and is often defined by the grim prognosis for its future. There are pressing development challenges which affect people's lives in Kiribati today, such as access to clean water, and dealing with increasing amounts of waste. As Claire Anterea from the environmental organisation Kirican has said 'we will drown in rubbish before we drown in water'. Exeter research work with Kirican, a Climate Change NGO in Kiribati, to co design a communitylevel programme towards sustainable development. The project funded a community initiative to provide educational workshops and buy two trucks to remove rubbish that was polluting the water supply and presenting a danger to children in three villages (Nanikai pop. 803; Banan pop. 1,170; Ambo pop. 1,688) on the Island of Tarawa (pop. 40,000). In order to empower the community, KiriCAN helped establish a new waste collection strategy utilising these trucks: about waste [the villages] really want to do something to solve it the trucks will give them hope.
