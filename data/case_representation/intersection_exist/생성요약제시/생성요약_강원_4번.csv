【Course description】
Peace studies is an “interdisciplinary research and education on the causes of
war and conditions of amity,” and what I personally refer to as peace studies is
conducted particularly from the standpoint of Christianity on the basis of God’s
creation and redemption.
The peace aimed at here is not just “negative peace,” which refers to a state
without warfare or discord, but also “positive peace,” which refers to a state
wherein structural violence such as poverty, oppression, and discrimination have
been eradicated. Structural violence is built into the social, cultural and economic
institutions. In the Bible, peace is signified by the Hebrew word “shalom,” which
is derived from the word meaning “complete,” and it represents peace in a
comprehensive sense. Shalom is a state of life that requires nothing, and it the
fulfillment of life in the existence of the living God, the love of human beings for
each other, and the fullness of life in the community of all cr eatures. It is something
completely intact. Consequently, the goal of peace studies broadly covers the
goals of the SDGs.
Here we will develop an ability to analyze the world situation, and we will develop
also a sensitivity towards concord, via the use of textbooks and audiovisual material.","The goal of this course is to develop an ability to analyze the world situation, and we will develop also a sensitivity towards concord, via the use of textbooks and audiovisual material."," 본 교과목의 목표는 세계정세를 분석하는 능력을 기르는 것이며, 교과서와 시청각자료를 활용하여 화합에 대한 감수성을 함양하는 것이다.",16,4

For example, providing users with training fails to considerhuman factors such as how rushed or stressed a person is while flickingthrough their emails. Even the most well-trained could accidentallyclick a malicious link while in such a state. Moreover, importantalerts are often excessive, warning users about routine activities tosuch an extent that users ignore them. What the team hopes to do isgather physiological data from users (such as eye motion and heartrate) during phishing simulations, and then use AI for personalisedinterventions, only in specific high-risk situations.
