Water Stewardship Programme
NUI Galway is committed to the effective and
efficient use of water throughout the campus
and the appropriate treatment, management
and disposal of wastewater. We are striving
to reduce our water usage and increase the
use of harvested rainwater through a series of
measures, including: water leakage detection
and repair programme, education and outreach,
process-related efficiency measures, greywater
and rainwater harvesting. As a participant in
the Water Stewardship Programme, we are
working in conjunction with Irish Water to
lower our water use and operating costs while
protecting the environment. The Sustainable
Water Partner badge demonstrates that key
staff have undertaken a course designed
to show leadership and set goals/targets in
reducing water consumption. Our NUI Galway
Water Stewardship Charter sets out our
commitment to maintain and achieve further
reductions in water usage on campus and to
highlight the importance of water as a critical
and limited resource. The Charter and our NUI
Galway Sustainability Strategy sets out our
commitment to reduce water usage on campus
by 10% by 2025 based on a 2018 baseline.",The aim of the Water Stewardship Programme is to reduce water usage and operating costs while protecting the environment., 물 관리 프로그램의 목표는 환경을 보호하면서 물 사용량과 운영 비용을 줄이는 것입니다.,6,2

Researchers have developed a powerful, low-cost method
for recycling used cooking oil and agricultural waste into
biodiesel, and turning food scraps and plastic rubbish into
high-value products. The method harnesses a new type of ultraefficient
catalyst that can make low-carbon biodiesel and other
valuable complex molecules out of diverse, impure raw materials.
Waste cooking oil currently has to go through an energy-intensive
cleaning process to be used in biodiesel, because commercial
production methods can only handle pure feedstocks with
1-2% contaminants. The new catalyst is so tough it can make
biodiesel from low-grade ingredients, known as feedstock,
containing up to 50% contaminants.
It is so efficient it could double the productivity of manufacturing
processes for transforming rubbish like food scraps,
microplastics and old tyres into high-value chemical precursors
used to make anything from medicines and fertilisers to
biodegradable packaging.","Researchers have developed a powerful, low-cost method for recycling used cooking oil and agricultural waste into biodiesel, and turning food scraps and plastic rubbish into high-value products.", 연구원들은 사용한 식용유와 농업 폐기물을 바이오디젤로 재활용하고 음식물 찌꺼기와 플라스틱 쓰레기를 고부가가치 제품으로 바꾸는 강력하고 저렴한 방법을 개발했습니다.,12,2

Some laboratories require certification and permittingfor the release of effluent. Management of hazardous waste is undertaken by certifiedprofessional service providers, with strict adherence to protocols.For other forms of waste, reuse, recycling and repurposing play an important role inour waste management programmes and the entire campus community is engaged inefforts to reduce waste that goes to landfill sites.

Water-efficient Building Design
Water-efficient building designs are a critical part in making water management
a reality. Our buildings are designed in consideration of Taiwan's green building
certification system (EEWH). We've improved the three major indicators of soil-water
retention, water resources, and garbage & sewage improvement to ensure that the
building can retain water and thereby prevent floods. Water-efficient hardware has been
installed and we recycle rainwater and reclaimed water to become more water-efficient.
Separate systems for rainwater and wastewater can also help increase the reuse value
of rainwater and reduce wastewater treatment load. The University currently has two

1124,일본,Sophia,"Human life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihoods. Plant
life provides 80 percent of our human diet, and we rely on agriculture as an important economic
resource and means of development. Forests account for 30 percent of the Earth’s surface,
providing vital habitats for millions of species and important sources for clean air and water; as
well as being crucial for combating climate change.
Today we are seeing unprecedented land degradation, and the loss of arable land at 30 to 35
times the historical rate. Drought and desertification is also on the rise each year, amounting to
the loss of 12 million hectares and affects poor communities globally. Of the 8,300 animal breeds
known, 8 percent are extinct and 22 percent are at risk of extinction.
About 80% of the Arab region is made up of dryland ecosystems, particularly fragile with
converging risks from climate change. Threatened species in the region stand at over 1,000, with
a majority being critically endangered. Of these, 24% are fish, 22% birds and 20% mammals. Arab
countries have made efforts to preserve their biodiversity, including through the expansion of
protected areas and sustainable use regimes in key ecosystems such as oases. As a percentage
of total territorial area, protected areas grew from 3.21% in 1990 to 9.28% in 2012.
The SDGs aim to conserve and restore the use of terrestrial ecosystems such as forests, wetlands,
drylands and mountains by 2020. Halting deforestation is also vital to mitigating the impact
of climate change. Urgent action must be taken to reduce the loss of natural habitats and
biodiversity which are part of our common heritage.

native landscapes
Groundsperson, William Pollack, adjacent to signage installed
before the start of the project to explain its benefits to the
Charles Sturt community.
In the context of a changing climate and increased
water scarcity, landscaping needs to adapt to drier
summers and less irrigated water. Charles Sturt’s
Wagga Wagga campus has approximately 18 ha
of irrigated turf and 5 ha of sub-surface irrigated
garden beds, including 55 controlled irrigated sites.
Funding was secured through a 2020 Sustainability
at Charles Sturt grant to reduce:
• unhealthy turf areas (due to soil fungi, shade
and root growth from mature trees)
• large turf spaces that do not serve a
functional purpose
• potable water use.
Areas are being replaced with climate suitable,
low/zero water use landscapes, replacing exotic
lawns with native ground covers, specifically grasses.
Work is underway and signage has been erected
to educate students, staff and visitors about the
changes taking place.
This project offers a test case that may be replicated
on other campuses.","The Charles Sturt University campus in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia, is undergoing a campus-wide water conservation project.", 호주 뉴사우스웨일즈 주 와가 와가에 있는 찰스 스튜어트 대학교 캠퍼스는 캠퍼스 전체의 물 절약 프로젝트를 진행하고 있습니다.,6,2

project groups and is contributing to Goals 1, 3, 4, and 12 through
the summer Cambodia volunteer project.
Among them, the “Pencil Project” is an activity to collect donated stationery and give it to
Cambodian children. By supporting children who have lost educational opportunities due
to a lack of stationery, they are contributing to Goal 4 “QUALITY EDUCATION.”
In addition, through the “Hygiene Project,” they are contributing to Goal 3 “GOOD HEALTH
AND WELL-BEING.” Unused toothbrushes are collected in Japan and distributed to local
children while teaching the importance of handwashing and tooth brushing.
Finally, there is the “Clothing Project,” which collects children’s clothes in Japan and gives
them to local children. By distributing clothes to children who used to wear the same
clothes every day, they contribute to Goal 1 “NO POVERTY” and Goal 12 “RESPONSIBLE
CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION.”
Since they cannot go to Cambodia due to COVID-19, they hold aca demic meetings to study
and share information about Cambodia.
