15,남아프리카 공화국,Pretoria,"Equality through access Through education, we build capability to improve the life chances of people, thereby creating conditions for young people to reach their full potential and helping them to escape the ubiquitous trap of poverty. Enabling and broadening access to university, particularly for students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds, is a strategic imperative. To achieve this, we have adopted an integrated approach across the student life cycle, partnering with various stakeholders to identify and nurture talent from high school through to graduation. A range of initiatives include the After School Programme (ASP) in partnership with the Gauteng Department of Education; a strategic partnership between the Faculty of Education and the National Department of Basic Education to recruit unemployed youth with good matric passes in scarce-skills subjects; and the development of virtual platforms to support recruitment of local and international students. The ASP provides support to Grade 10 to 12 learners in the Mamelodi area, for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM subjects), and is coupled to a Teacher Mentorship Programme offered for Grade 4 to 9 mathematics and science teachers. Within the ASP, the range of offerings include weekend classes; self-paced tutorials using e-learning software; spring and winter schools; and training in life skills, study methods and computer literacy. The University’s undergraduate recruitment strategy emphasises the importance of responsible study and career choices, including the employability of students. Based on this holistic, student life cycle approach, with support from UNICEF and other sponsors, the University developed and launched the Junior Tukkie – UNICEF Online Platform to support recruitment and study choices.

16,남아프리카 공화국,Pretoria,"An inclusive and equitable community In nurturing a transformed, inclusive, and equitable university community, we embrace diversity and are actively working towards addressing inequality affecting both students and staff. This intent is in large part governed by the UP Anti-discrimination Policy and Operations Manual. In seeking to build an inclusive, affirming, and transformed institutional culture, curriculum, and campus and residence life, the policy focuses on the prevention of unfair discrimination, hate speech, harassment, violence based on prohibited grounds, retaliation, and the promotion of substantive equality. It is supported by an Operations Manual, which guides the policy’s implementation. A key aspect of inequality is gender-based violence (GBV) in all its forms, to which the University has a zero tolerance stance. Additionally, gender equality goes beyond addressing the adverse impacts of inequality and includes promoting and celebrating the success of women in our university community. Changes to the demographic profile of students and staff is an important indicator of our contributions to reducing inequality.

A UCL report showed that people are facing multiple levels of disadvantage and proposed that the UK government needed to take a new approach to solve social inequalities.
In 2019, a partnership between UCL’s Grand Challenge of Justice & Equality, UCL Public Policy and the Resolution Foundation think tank, brought together organisations from across academia, business, government, policy and the third sector to develop an intersectional understanding of inequalities in
the UK and explore how policy can more effectively address structural inequalities.
‘Exploring Inequalities: Igniting research to better inform UK policy’, sought to understand the complex, interlinking factors such as education, access
to opportunity and regional differences. The project’s final report, ‘Structurally Unsound’ showed that certain groups face multiple levels of disadvantage, with structural inequalities emerging before birth and accumulating during a person’s life. “The issues driving inequality must be understood as complex and interlinked,” says report lead author Siobhan Morris (UCL Grand Challenge of Justice & Equality).",A University College London (UCL) report recommends a new approach to tackling structural inequalities in the UK., UCL(University College London) 보고서는 영국의 구조적 불평등을 해결하기 위한 새로운 접근 방식을 권장합니다.,1,1

Economists at UCL argue that inequality should be considered when regulators intervene in the ability of financial institutions to provide credit.
“Current thinking among economists highlights the impact of imperfections in the credit system on the economy as it goes through periods of recession and boom. But existing models do not consider the impact on individual household’s ability to avoid financial hardship,” explains Dr Ralph Luetticke (UCL Economics).
Depending on their financial outgoings, and whether they have savings or other assets, households vary greatly in their ability to withstand economic shocks, such as unemployment. Many have to rely on credit cards and loans.
Dr Luetticke and his departmental colleague Professor Morten Ravn wanted to develop insights to allow a deeper understanding of financial regulation and its interaction with inequality.

RMIT is dedicated to creating life-changing educational experiences
for all students from all backgrounds and offering connected
pathways between life, work and learning, supporting people to
personalise the education that will best meet their needs. A tertiary
education can transform the lives of students, giving them the
opportunity to access knowledge and pursue their passion. The
RMIT Philanthropy Fund was established thanks to the generosity of
donors to support scholarships, research and other major projects.
RMIT provides an extensive range of assistance and support
for financially vulnerable students including emergency
accommodation, vouchers and grants. In 2019 there were 2,144
scholarships awarded from 17,984 applications. To help to eliminate
the financial barriers which prevent students from pursuing tertiary
study, over 1,800 students benefitted from RMIT equity-based
scholarships.
Commencing student retention rates for those receiving a
scholarship in 2019 was higher (91%) than non-scholarship holders
(80.9%) and continuing students who hold a scholarship have a
retention rate of 90.7% in comparison to non-scholarship holders
at 83.6%. RMIT also recognises a signigicant $1 million gift from

For low-income Australians, saving enough money to provide
educational basics such as school uniforms for their children, or
increasing their own employability through education can seem
out of reach. Improving the financial literacy of these vulnerable
Australians provides the backbone to improving their financial
wellbeing and educational opportunities for themselves and
their families. Collaborating with ANZ and the Brotherhood of St
Laurence, RMIT has definitively shown the long-term improvement
in the financial health of lower-income Australians who are involved
in matched-savings programs such as Saver Plus. The first program
of its kind in Australia, Saver Plus was developed by the School
of Economics, Finance and Marketing to encourage saving for
educational expenses.
With more than 46,000 participants since 2003, it is the largest and
longest-running savings program in the world. The program involves
financial education workshops and participants making regular
deposits into an account then after ten months, ANZ matches the
amount up to $500. This research showed that even up to seven
years after completing Saver Plus, 87 per cent of participants were
still saving the same amount or more, demonstrating the long-lasting
effect of such schemes. The research also demonstrated marked
improvements in the financial wellbeing score of participants,
increasing the average score of 64 out of 100 following the program
compared to the national average score of just 59.","RMIT's School of Economics, Finance and Marketing and the Brotherhood of St Laurence have been working together to improve the financial wellbeing of low-income Australians."," RMIT의 경제, 금융 및 마케팅 학교와 세인트 로렌스 형제단은 저소득 호주인의 재정적 웰빙을 개선하기 위해 협력해 왔습니다.",1,1

Globally, natural disasters kill an average of 60,000 people per year.
Ninety-five per cent of disaster-related deaths occur in developing
countries. Economic losses associated with natural disasters are
estimated to be 15 times higher today than they were in the 1950s.
Such shocks are widely acknowledged to disproportionately affect
the poorest in society because they have fewer ways of coping with
these shocks. For example, they may have less or no savings and
inadequate housing.
Moreover, recurrent shocks increase the vulnerability of the poor
to disasters, possibly placing communities perpetually at risk and
reducing their ability to break out of a poverty cycle. Researchers
at RMIT have been investigating how households that experience
environmental shocks cope to make ends using household-level
data from Vietnam.
The work of Centre for International Development also examines the
impact of environmental shocks on child health and parents’ mental
health. Existing literature demonstrates that environmental shocks
can impact child health by reducing household income or through

Food waste is a growing issue in many countries, including Australia, with the latest figures showing that in 2016-17 we produced 7.3 million tonnes of food waste, with almost 300kg per person going to landfill every year. An RMIT researcher spent two weeks at the Mars Desert Research Station in the US state of Utah, examining how the conditions of a Mars mission simulation with a limited choice of food, preparation and cooking options would affect the food waste generated.
Findings show that non-perishable food can create less waste in constrained circumstances - a finding highly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research team noted that waste is more likely when preparing meals that alter in form (such as cooking dried rice) and/or combine multiple ingredients.
Recommendations suggested to avoid food waste include:
•
Buying only what you need, and will use
•
If you run a food business, divert excess consumable food to food rescue organisations and charities that feed the hungry
•
Where possible, give food waste to animals, such as backyard chooks
•

80,000 Australians. Many treatment options for Parkinson’s are only
effective when the condition is caught early, but by the time patients
show any commonly recognisable symptoms, many nerve cells in
the brain have already suffered irreversible damage.
The new tool can spot the disease when there are no obvious
symptoms and can also be used to monitor Parkinson’s patients
after diagnosis, to better manage their condition. The technology
analyses drawing and writing tasks to catch the disease before
obvious symptoms. The screening test involves completing seven
dexterity tasks on a drawing tablet, including simple writing, writing
with memory load and drawing a spiral by joining dots. The test
can create a patient-specific baseline for the different aspects of
complex Parkinson’s symptoms. The data is transmitted over the

Women who spend time in mental health inpatient facilities are not
being protected from gender-based violence, according to new

health inpatient units’ shows women have experienced sexual
assault, harassment and related threats from other inpatients, visitors
and even staff in some facilities. Conducted by researchers from
RMIT’s School of Global, Urban and Social Studies and Charles Sturt
University, the study also found many services lacked appropriate
policies and procedures to support women who reported such
violence during their stay. The research team points out that while
some examples of women receiving supportive responses were
uncovered, incidents of harassment were frequently disbelieved or
not taken seriously. Australia’s National Research Organisation for
Women’s Safety (ANROWS) commissioned the study.","Women who spend time in mental health inpatient facilities are not being protected from gender-based violence, according to new research.", 새로운 연구에 따르면 정신 건강 입원 환자 시설에서 시간을 보내는 여성들은 젠더 기반 폭력으로부터 보호받지 못하고 있습니다.,5,1

RMIT’s Centre for Innovative Justice (CIJ) is conducting an ongoing
evaluation of Women Transforming Justice (WTJ), a collaboration
between the Fitzroy Legal Service (incorporating Darebin Community
Legal Centre), the Law and Advocacy Centre for Women (LACW)
and Flat Out. The project is funded by the Legal Services Board and
provides gender-informed legal assistance specifically to women
seeking bail, combined with follow up case management and other
support to women either while they are in custody or the community.
WTJ recognises the very particular needs of a growing cohort within
our community: women on remand – as well as the disproportionate
impacts that recent bail and other legislative reforms have had on
women and their children.
The CIJ’s evaluation over the life of the project is assessing its
implementation, the specific needs of women on remand and the

In 2020, RMIT joined the Financial Inclusion Action Plan (FIAP),
a program designed to improve financial inclusion and
resilience amongst our students. Through our participation
in the FIAP program (undertaken in collaboration with Good
Shepherd Australia New Zealand and the FIAP Partnership
group), RMIT aims to develop an additional whole-of-University
framework to enhance our current support to students. This
includes scholarships for living and study-related expenses and
accommodation, emergency financial assistance, and financial
capability building by providing information, tools and other
resources. These initiatives will provide comprehensive support
for students by addressing inequalities, including financial
hardship. Through this approach, RMIT will be able to evaluate
the impact of current policies and identify opportunities to
enhance responses to address barriers to financial inclusion.
Inclusion is one of our core values. RMIT believes that education
is a pathway to employment and economic security and should
therefore be accessible to students from all backgrounds and
circumstances. RMIT celebrates and welcomes
diversity, and is committed to providing appropriate support
to enable students to succeed in their studies and beyond.
The University’s action plan will improve our understanding of
the complexities associated with financial inclusion. It will allow
RMIT to develop new and innovative responses to encourage
meaningful economic participation and improve the economic
status of our students. This will include ensuring our programs

The RMIT needs-based scholarship program helps eliminate
the financial barriers that prevent students from pursuing tertiary
studies. This allows students to devote more time to study, and
therefore supports retention and completion rates. In 2020,
RMIT awarded more than 2,200 scholarships to Vocational
Education and Higher Education undergraduate students.
These scholarships were valued collectively at over $6.8m,

RMIT recognises that tertiary education can transform the
lives of students, and give them the opportunity to both access
knowledge and pursue their passion. RMIT provides an extensive
range of assistance and support for financially vulnerable
students, including emergency accommodation, vouchers
and grants.
Philanthropic funds are managed by RMIT’s Philanthropic Fund
Committee, and in 2020 a total of $2.8 million of philanthropic
funds were disbursed across the University. In 2020, RMIT
provided 611 philanthropic scholarships, 30 technology grants
for vocational students, and 8,000 relief grants to students
during the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, 400 students received
philanthropically funded emergency food and care packages.
The COVID-19 pandemic left many students
disadvantaged financially, academically, and personally.
The lockdowns in response to COVID-19 resulted in a sudden
shift to remote learning, loss of employment, childcare demands,
and physical confinement, which created challenges for student
retention and success. In response to this unprecedented
crisis, RMIT provided over 8,000 students with financial support
from the University COVID-19 support package. The total
value of the financial package was over $10.5 million. A further
19 students also received emergency accommodation at
Walert House (for an average of 49 days) and two partner
accommodation providers (for an average of 116 days).",RMIT has been named Australia’s top university for student satisfaction for the fourth year in a row.,RMIT는 4년 연속 호주 최고의 학생 만족도 대학으로 선정되었습니다.,1,1

Developing an inclusive financial system is an important
policy intervention to reduce poverty, create opportunities for
economic growth, and improve living standards. However,
despite the growing and focused research interest on financial
inclusion, empirical findings on its role in accelerating economic
development are mixed and inconclusive. This has limited the
development of a conclusive evidence base to inform policies
and strategies to address financial exclusion.
RMIT academics Dr Ashenafi Biru and Professor Alemayehu
Molla conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to
unravel the sources of inconsistencies in financial inclusion
studies. Funded by the Korea Development Institute School of
Public Policy and Management, they provided a comprehensive
synthesis of the current literature on financial inclusion, analysing
the link between financial inclusion, various measures of poverty
and income inequality. Using 67 empirical studies, Dr Biru and
Professor Molla found that inconsistent measurement of financial
inclusion and outcome indicators has resulted in uncertainty
about the most effective forms of financial systems for yielding
better livelihood changes. They identified that work that develops
well-defined financial inclusion intervention and outcome
indicators, and incorporates advances in digital finance, will
help remove barriers from both the supply and demand sides of
financial inclusion.","Researchers at RMIT University have produced a synthesis of the current literature on financial inclusion, analysing the link between financial inclusion and various measures of poverty and income inequality.",RMIT 대학의 연구원들은 금융 포용과 빈곤 및 소득 불평등의 다양한 측정 사이의 연관성을 분석하여 금융 포용에 관한 최신 문헌을 종합했습니다.,1,1

Associate Professor Sefa Awaworyi Churchill from the School

Hyderabad, India, recently conducted unique social research to
provide valuable insight into poverty alleviation. In their research,
over 45,000 Indian households were surveyed to investigate
the role of financial inclusion programs in reducing poverty.
Financial inclusion programs are those which extend access
to financial services such as banking, loans and finance to all
members of society, including the poorest. Many people take
access to financial services for granted, but being able to have
a bank account, and receive loans and credit play an important
part of day-to-day life. By distributing a survey so broadly,
the researchers could collect and analyse meaningful and
complete data. They found that access to financial services can
increase resilience to financial shocks, and therefore facilitates
opportunities to move out of poverty. These important findings
can help inform financial inclusion policy in India and other
developing nations.","Researchers from RMIT University in Australia and the University of Hyderabad in India have found that access to financial services can increase resilience to financial shocks, and therefore facilitates opportunities to move out of poverty.", 호주 RMIT 대학과 인도 하이데라바드 대학의 연구원들은 금융 서비스에 대한 접근성이 재정적 충격에 대한 회복력을 증가시켜 빈곤에서 벗어날 수 있는 기회를 촉진할 수 있다는 것을 발견했습니다.,1,1

RMIT researchers are investigating the use of Bitastic
LiDAR sensors (operated on ground level and also by drones)
to determine the health of fruit in whole orchards through
measuring indicators of photosynthesis and fruit quality.
Sensors like Bitastic LiDAR will help prevent food waste by
optimising harvest times based on consumer preference. This
technological innovation will also make the Australian stone fruit
crop more efficient, sustainable, and profitable. Development
of harvest technology such as these sensors can help farmers
to pinpoint ideal harvest times and plays an important role in

A team of researchers led by RMIT Dr Roya Afshari has
developed a method to detect biomarkers (unique markers,
almost like fingerprints) in cheese manufacturing. Biochemical
changes that occur during the ripening stage of cheese
production determine the quality and taste of the cheese.
Cheese-making is currently a complex and expensive process,
as a batch of cheese can be ripening for months or years before
a problem is identified.
The new research into biomarkers allows new batches of cheese
to be analysed and compared to successful past batches only
30 days into the ageing process. This process can also help
automate the process of grading and ageing cheese. Data on
the chemical profile of a high-quality batch can be compared
with the ripening cheese. This data assessment can also be
combined with the traditional taste-based assessment to
ensure a more objective quality assessment process.
The bioanalysis method can be expanded to adapt to almost
all types of food and beverage production, making it a useful tool
in the fight against counterfeit food and drinks, including the illicit
trade of counterfeit wines, valued at millions of dollars. Through
bioanalysis, wines can be analysed to determine their ingredients
and origin.
The innovative bioanalysis method also has the potential to make
food and drink production more effective and sustainable by
increasing the capacity and accuracy of production and reducing
waste.",Researchers at RMIT University have developed a new method to assess the quality and taste of cheese.,RMIT 대학의 연구원들은 치즈의 품질과 맛을 평가하는 새로운 방법을 개발했습니다.,2,1

Professor Michael Buxton and Associate Professor Andrew
Butt from RMIT’s School of Global, Urban and Social Studies
co-authored a new book, The Future of the Fringe: The Crisis
in Peri-Urban Planning. This book focuses on food systems,
rather than production techniques, and reveals how unmitigated
urban expansion is a hidden threat to food security in Australian
cities.
The Future of the Fringe highlights the importance of the periurban
fringe (land within 150km of city edges) in both food
production and food security. Land surrounding cities is often
highly productive and yields valuable crops including vegetables,
poultry, berry fruits and eggs. Its proximity to major population
centres also makes transporting food produced on the urban
fringe easier and more sustainable than imports or rural-based
production.
In Australia, peri-urban ecosystems such as the Cumberland
Plains near Sydney and the Western Grasslands near Melbourne
also support high concentrations of threatened native biodiversity
that is vital for the structure and function of already degraded
ecosystems. The Future of the Fringe discusses these points as
they relate to food security, and suggests methods of protecting
the urban fringe through planning controls to limit development
in the peri-urban fringe.","Food security in Australian cities Professor Michael Buxton and Associate Professor Andrew Butt from RMIT’s School of Global, Urban and Social Studies co-authored a new book, The Future of the Fringe: The Crisis in Peri-Urban Planning."," 호주 도시의 식량 안보 RMIT 글로벌, 도시 및 사회 연구 대학의 Michael Buxton 교수와 Andrew Butt 부교수는 새로운 책인 The Future of the Fringe: The Crisis in Peri-Urban Planning을 공동 저술했습니다.",2,1

This project draws on local and international expertise to
develop and disseminate new models and planning guidelines
for 21st-century municipal markets in Victoria. It aims to provide
an evidence base, design principles, and technical guidance

drug-resistant superbugs
In 2020, researchers from RMIT used liquid metals to develop
new bacteria-destroying technology, providing a potential
solution to the deadly threat posed by antibiotic-resistant
bacteria. The technology trialled at RMIT uses nano-sized
particles of magnetic liquid metal to shred bacteria and bacterial
biofilm – the protective “house” that bacteria thrive in – without
harming other cells.
Published in ACS Nano, the research offers a groundbreaking
new direction in the search for better bacteria-fighting
technologies. Antibiotic resistance is a major global health threat,
causing at least 700,000 deaths a year. Without action, the death
toll could rise to ten million people a year by 2050, overtaking
cancer as a cause of death. The biggest issues are the spread of
dangerous, drug-resistant superbugs, and the growth of bacterial
biofilm infections, which can no longer be treated with existing
antibiotics. The RMIT team behind the technology is the only
group in the world investigating the antibacterial potential
of magnetic liquid metal nanoparticles.
The team includes PhD researcher Sheeana Gangadoo,
Dr James Chapman, Dr Aaron Elbourne, and Dr Vi Khanh
Truong. Together, they plan to expand the technology beyond

to improve ovarian cancer diagnosis
Researchers from RMIT have developed a simple blood test
that measures the body’s own immune response to improve

most common gynaecologic cancers, with the highest mortality
rate of any. About 300,000 new cases are diagnosed globally

specific immune biomarker allows clinicians to identify whether
growths on the ovaries are cancerous or not, without the
need for tests like MRI scans or ultrasounds.
The clinical trial was conducted in two hospitals in Melbourne,
with the results published in the academic journal Scientific
Reports. Senior Author and Chief Investigator, Professor

be devastating for pregnant women
New research, led by RMIT in collaboration with researchers

why flu can lead to life-threatening complications during
pregnancy, suggesting the virus does not stay in the lungs but
spreads throughout the mother’s body. The pre-clinical study has
overturned current scientific thinking surrounding the reasons
why flu infections affect pregnant women and their babies so
severely.
The findings could also help researchers working to understand
the fundamental biology of how COVID-19, another respiratory
disease, spreads from the lungs into the body. Research in
animal models showed that during pregnancy flu spreads from
the lungs through the blood vessels into the circulatory system,
triggering a damaging hyperactive immune response. Lead
author Dr Stella Liong said the research suggests the vascular
system is at the heart of potentially devastating complications
caused by influenza during pregnancy. She also stated that
conventional thinking blamed the suppressed immune system
that occurs in pregnancy, but the research found the opposite
effect – flu infection leads to a drastically heightened immune
response.",A new study reveals why flu can be devastating for pregnant women., 독감이 임산부에게 치명적일 수 있는 이유가 새로운 연구에서 밝혀졌습니다.,3,1

antiviral treatment for COVID-19
New research into malaria suggests targeting enzymes from
the human host, rather than from the pathogen itself, could offer
effective treatment for a range of infectious diseases, including
COVID-19. The study, conducted by an international team and
led by RMIT University’s Professor Christian Doerig, outlines
a strategy that could save years of research and millions of
dollars in drug development by repurposing existing treatments
designed for other diseases such as cancer.
The approach has received government funding for its potential
application in the fight against COVID-19. The study, published
in the academic journal Nature Communications, demonstrated
that parasites which cause malaria are heavily dependent on
enzymes in red blood cells, where they hide and proliferate.
It also revealed that drugs developed for cancer, and which
inactivate these human enzymes (known as protein kinases) are
highly effective in killing parasites and represent an alternative
to drugs that target the parasite itself. This approach has the
potential to considerably reduce the cost and accelerate the
deployment of new and urgently needed antimalarials. As well
as enabling the repurposing of drugs, the approach is likely
to reduce the emergence of drug-resistant malaria. With an
enzyme-based approach, the pathogen cannot escape by
simply mutating the target of the drug, as is the case for
most currently available antimalarials.","New research suggests targeting enzymes from the human host, rather than from the pathogen itself, could offer effective treatment for a range of infectious diseases, including CO-19.",새로운 연구는 병원체 자체가 아닌 인간 숙주의 효소를 표적으로 삼는 것이 CO-19를 포함한 다양한 전염병에 효과적인 치료법을 제공할 수 있음을 시사합니다.,3,1

A commitment to sustainability is part of the fabric of our
digital learning and teaching environment. In 2020, sustainabilityfocused
outcomes were practically delivered through two
broad streams of work:
Stream 1: Optimising the digital learning environment
to robustly handle unprecedented usage.
As campus access for learning and teaching activities was
extensively restricted for much of 2020, learners and teachers
needed support to continue their activities with as little disruption
as possible. RMIT’s Education Portfolio worked extensively
with partners (particularly Information Technology Services
and college learning and teaching teams) to appropriately
adapt to the digital learning environment.
Stream 2: Shifting a wide variety of learning
and teaching activities online.
From a sustainability perspective, increased usage of the
digital learning environment is particularly promising as it
offers future opportunities for students to make choices in how
and when they learn. During 2020, RMIT was forced to shift as
much learning and teaching activity as was possible online when
campuses were closed. The quick roll-out of remote learning
means that students now have more flexible access to course
learning materials when they need them. There is now far less
expectation on students to travel to campus for activities such
as lectures which are largely based around the transmission of

The inaugural Global Learning Festival (GLF) ran from 1-4
September 2020 and was co-led by Wyndham City Council
and Melton City Council. The festival included an important
partnership with the Australian Learning Communities Network
(ALCN) and RMIT University. This ambitious project had the goal
of creating unity between learning cities and communities across
the globe, while supporting the Sustainable Development Goals
around Lifelong Learning (SDG4: Quality Education), Strong
Institutions (SDG16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions)
and Partnerships for Change (SDG17: Partnerships for the
Goals). As a part of the Global Learning Festival, the Australian
Learning Communities Network and Wyndham City Council
formally partnered to host an RMIT student from the Master of
International Development to research and evaluate the festival.
The student selected for this placement, Hellen Kibowen, shared
many invaluable insights from her own community in Kenya and
her previous studies and experiences in anthropology.
Additionally, post-festival, RMIT led a qualitative evaluation
session with 20 key global project partners using tools such
as the Most Significant Change Technique and the Collective
Impact Assessment Tool to measure the impact of this innovative
partnership. The final GLF report was circulated to various
community partners, including the Place and Social Capital

as Transformation
Training of Master Trainers is a two-year project that aims
to improve teaching in the Non-formal Education System in
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).
The project was developed to train adult educators who can
combine methodical expertise with an understanding of the
concept of Andragogy and Lifelong Learning.
The training plan focused on practice rather than theory,
specifically tailored for the Lao culture and local learning habits.
Additional practical exercises such as coaching and mentoring
on-site and an elective Module on Gender Mainstreaming were
integrated into the basic guidelines of Curriculum globALE
(Adult Learning and Education).
Aside from developing 35 Master Trainers in youth and adult
education across various organisations in Lao PDR, partnerships
were also developed to assist these Master Trainers to apply and
continue developing their skills. These partnerships were both
institutional and thematic, highlighting the ways in which SDG
4 (Quality Education) could be met and how adult teaching and
learning could also transform work towards other SDGs.
The Training of Master Trainers project was an important
case study that has informed the wider learning in the EU
Jean Monnet Network on the Role of the European Union in
implementing the SDGs in the Asia Pacific. While starting as a
project aiming to contribute to professionally developing nonformal

barriers to school education
An important cornerstone of inclusive education is
creating education systems that are accessible to all students.
Unfortunately, many students with disabilities are missing out
on a quality education due to outdated ideas about managing
children’s behaviour in schools.
In 2020, Dr David Armstrong, Senior Lecturer at RMIT University,
spoke at the Disability Royal Commission, at a special hearing
entitled ‘Barriers to accessing a safe, quality and inclusive
school education and life course impacts.’
Dr Armstrong argued that current ‘manage-and-discipline’
methods used in many Australian schools foster exclusion and
disengagement of students with disabilities. He recommended
that teachers be trained in a new approach based on positive
reinforcement for dealing with students with disabilities who are
perceived to be creating behavioural difficulties. Dr Armstrong
finished his testimony detailing the disenfranchisement rooted
in expulsion and suspension of students with disabilities and
suggested a focus on the cause of bad behaviour (often
influenced by social determinants), rather than punishment.
His testimony will be incorporated into the Disability Royal
Commission’s report, which is due to be finalised in 2022.","Dr David Armstrong, Senior Lecturer at RMIT University, spoke at the Disability Royal Commission, at a special hearing entitled ‘Barriers to accessing a safe, quality and inclusive school education and life course impacts.’", RMIT 대학의 선임 강사인 Dr. David Armstrong은 '안전하고 질적이며 포괄적인 학교 교육에 대한 장벽과 인생 과정의 영향'이라는 제목의 특별 청문회에서 왕립 장애 위원회(Disability Royal Commission)에서 연설했습니다.,4,1

strategic, sustainable and meaningful change across the
three priority areas: leadership and governance, employment
conditions, and women’s career advancement.
In 2019-2020, 58.3% of leadership promotions at RMIT
were awarded to women, and 60.5% of all appointments were
women. In 2020, 55.9% of RMIT’s managers were female, and

RMIT has been awarded Employer of Choice for Gender
Equality citation (awarded by the Workplace Gender Equality
Agency) each year since 2018. The Employer of Choice citation
highlights the extraordinary efforts undertaken across the
University to drive positive change for gender equality. In 2020,
RMIT continued to work hard to put its commitment to gender
equality into practice, with a focus on attracting, supporting
and progressing women.
In 2020, RMIT achieved Bronze status (highest available) in
the Athena SWAN program for Women in STEM (Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), and began
implementing a five-year action plan across the University’s
eight STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics
and Medicine) schools. The action plans aim to build a more
inclusive, diverse and supportive environment for female
students and staff at RMIT.
Athena SWAN has an international reputation for creating
a gender-inclusive workplace, with accredited institutions
demonstrating a competitive edge in attracting the best
scientists and engineers. Athena Scientific Women’s Academic
Network (SWAN) Charter is the most comprehensive and
practical scheme to improve academics’ careers by addressing
gender inequity. Women in Science, Technology, Engineering,
Mathematics and Medicine employed in organisations
participating in the Athena SWAN Charter experience greater
career satisfaction and fairness in the workload allocation,
and increased opportunities for training and development.
As the University works towards Silver accreditation, the action
plan will focus on seven key areas, from Leading Local Action
and Building the Pipeline to Transforming Cultures and Engaging
in Moments of Transition.","RMIT University has a long-standing commitment to gender equality, with a focus on attracting, supporting and progressing women."," RMIT 대학은 여성을 유치, 지원 및 발전시키는 데 중점을 두고 양성 평등에 대한 오랜 약속을 가지고 있습니다.",5,1

measures gender pay equity and meets the requirements
of the Australian Workplace Gender Equality Act of 2012.
A “Pay Equity Update Report” is also prepared and presented
annually to key internal and external stakeholders. This report
measures and tracks pay scale gender equity, establishes action
plans to address improvement opportunities and provides results

388,호주,RMIT,"4. Female career progression
In Australia, one of the key places where women face
discrimination is the workplace. For many years, women across
the world have been told that the solution to this problem is to
simply “lean in” by embodying the characteristics stereotypically
associated with men in the workforce: confidence and ambition.
However, Dr Leonora Risse, an economics lecturer at RMIT
University, has found that being more confident and ambitious
does not provide a payoff for women. Dr Risse proposed
that encouraging women to “lean in” in fact does more harm
than good, as it inadvertently cements the idea that so-called
“masculine” characteristics are more desirable in the workplace.
Dr Risse summarised this research in an article for The
Conversation, which was shared on Facebook nearly 10,000
times, and covered by major media outlets including Forbes.
This attention, in combination with her broader media
commentary and established track record on gender equality
research, led the Victorian Government Equal Workplace
Advisory Committee to invite Dr Risse to write a series of reports
on policy recommendations to support women’s employment
in the Victorian State Budget. This research is essential as it
challenges our current thinking, which assigns blame to the
individual rather than the broader social context","In our series of letters from Australian journalists, Dr Leonora Risse, an economics lecturer at RMIT University, looks at four key areas in which women face discrimination.", 호주 언론인들이 보낸 일련의 편지에서 RMIT 대학의 경제학 강사인 Dr Leonora Risse는 여성이 차별에 직면하는 네 가지 주요 영역을 살펴봅니다.,5,1

(SDG 5 or SDG16)
Dr Lauren Gurrieri, a Senior Lecturer at the School of
Economics, Finance and Marketing (EFM), focuses her research
on investigating how gendered portrayals in advertising both
contribute to gender inequality and act as cultural drivers of
violence against women.
While examining the current state of our media landscape,
Dr Gurrieri also works to identify good practice which can
prevent sexism in advertising. In 2020, Dr Gurrieri continued her
work in addressing this deep-rooted inequality by contributing
to research on sexualised labour in digital culture, sexual
violence in the pornography market, and the performance of
member states reports to the Global Alliance on Media and
Gender (GAMAG).
Dr Gurrieri is a Reference Group Member for shEqual, an initiative
led by Women’s Health Victoria which receives funding from the
Victorian State Government. This has allowed her to transform
her research into policy reform across Victoria, including in
the state-wide framework for championing gender equality in
advertising, ‘Seeing is Believing’, which was produced in 2020.
This led to a gender equity training program being created
by shEqual for the advertising industry. Through shEqual,
Dr Gurrieri’s work was also used to inform revisions to the Code
of Ethics for the Australian Association of National Advertisers,
which is used to guide advertising and marketing industry

The Women Transforming Justice (WTJ) Project, a partnership
between RMIT’s Centre for Innovative Justice (CIJ) and the
Victorian Legal Services Board, sought to find causes and
solutions to the rising rates of incarceration of women in Victoria.
Commissioned by Fitzroy Legal Service Inc, the WTJ Project
focused on preventing women’s incarceration and recidivism
through three mechanisms: the facilitation of a leadership
group for women with lived experience in the justice system,
the development of an integrated Court Support Program for
women, and systemic reform. The CIJ found that the needs
of incarcerated and recently released female prisoners were
complex, and current social services are incapable of meeting
them holistically.
This program was piloted for two years by the CIJ from 2019-
2020. Ultimately, the CIJ found that the pilot programs were able
to successfully meet the immediate social needs of the female
participants. The Court Support Program resulted in better
legal outcomes for women, while the leadership group provided
participants with training and leadership opportunities, often
leading to a sense of empowerment amongst participants.
The component of the WTJ project that focused on systemic
reform has also succeeded in engaging stakeholders with
the issues faced by women in the justice system.
The report concluded that although several systemic factors
which contribute to women’s incarceration and poor justice
outcomes are outside of the scope of change the WTJ Project
can influence, the project was a success and should be
expanded.","The aim of this report was to examine the causes of women’s incarceration and poor justice outcomes in Victoria, Australia.", 이 보고서의 목적은 호주 빅토리아에서 여성 투옥의 원인과 열악한 사법 결과를 조사하는 것이었습니다.,5,1

has worked with Charles Sturt staff and clinicians
from the Mid-North Coast Local Health District for
more than three years to provide evidence that
would support advocacy efforts by Parkinson’s
NSW for specialist Parkinson’s nurses in regional,
rural and remote NSW. Access to specialist
movement disorder neurological services is
extremely limited outside of major cities with 93
per cent of neurologists located in urban areas.
The findings from a three-stage study have been
reported widely and in 2020 led to Department of
Health funding for rural Primary Health Networks
to undertake a pilot program placing movement
disorder specialist nurses in rural and remote areas.
The pilot will substantially improve health outcomes
for patients in the region by providing more trained
staff in more readily accessible locations for
patients. The program will remove the barriers for
12 registered nurses to access theoretical
knowledge, practical skills through supported
industry placements, and ongoing mentoring
and networking support, ultimately leading to
a sustainable and customised model of care

sustainability with climate sustainability (e.g. taking sustainable

employability of employees is immediately enhanced while they
reduce their ecological footprint at the same time.

department of Internal Medicine, together with the start-up
company ‘Sustainable Me’. Your World was created in collaboration
with Dr. Gerdien de Vries (climate psychologist) and Dr. Rens

both work at Delft University of Technology. Your
World is an excellent example of the synergy that
the collaboration between Delft University of

function of Your World enables the resilience of
employees to be measured at group level. In 2020,

One recent research by our Master
degree student was on “Factors
predicting well-being among emerging
and middle-aged adults”. The
objective of the study was to (1)
compare self-efficacy, emotional
intelligence, self-compassion
and mental well-being between
emerging and middle-aged adults;
(2) determine whether selfefficacy, emotional intelligence
and self-compassion predict
mental well-being; (3) investigate
if self-compassion mediates the
relationship between self-efficacy
and mental well-being and between
emotional intelligence and mental
wellbeing in both age groups. The
outcome of this study can provide
insights to understanding the
mediating role of self-compassion
of emotional intelligence towards
mental wellbeing.","The School of Medical and Life Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is one of the largest medical schools in the United States.","UCLA(University of California, Los Angeles)의 의과 및 생명 과학 학교는 미국에서 가장 큰 의과 대학 중 하나입니다.",3,1

Desert locusts and swarming short-horned
grasshoppers have been destroying crops in Africa

January last year, the locusts flew from the Red
Sea coast of Sudan and Eritrea to hit Saudi Arabia
and Iran. They entered Pakistan’s southwestern
Balochistan province in March and affected
different parts of Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab and
KPK province. Aerial spraying is one of the most
effective remedies for destroying and controlling
locust swarms, especially for the ones sitting on
trees with big canopies, where other solutions
might not be effective.

pest control in Tobacco leaves, Kharian for organic
nutrients in guava orchards, Chakwal for pest
control in wheat crop.

The smart aquaponics system integrates aquaculture (i.e. fish farming) and hydroponics (i.e. growing
plants in a soilless medium). The objective of this project by NUST researchers is to provide an alternative
to the traditional food production on industrial as well as private sectors. The proposed system is particularly
useful for urban areas with low land and overpopulation. The system is portable, light-weight , and
requires minimal human interference during the cultivation process which provides organic and cheaper
produce than traditionally grown crops.
In a country like, Pakistan where water shortage and overpopulation are major issues, this system will
use approximately 90% less water as compared to land-based farming via water recycling and result in
a larger crop yield per meter square. This project will not only contribute towards improvement of agricultural
methods but also serve positively to the Pakistani society and economy.",This project aims to develop a smart aquaponics system in Pakistan., 이 프로젝트는 파키스탄에서 스마트 아쿠아포닉스 시스템을 개발하는 것을 목표로 합니다.,2,1

after Turkey, to have its own facility for cardiac
stent production. As per the World Health
Organization (WHO), Pakistan stands 18th in the

exorbitant prices of imported cardiac implants,
which over 80 percent patients find inaccessible.

quality stents within the reach of these patients,
but also saves huge sums of foreign exchange
every year for the national exchequer. NHT is
an ISO 13485: 2016 certified facility accredited

【Abstract】
Governments worldwide are increasingly enacting family
policies, which include cash transfers, child allowances,
maternity / parental leave, and preschool education and
care policies. It is because they recognize the role of
families as an elementary unit of society. How do family
policies affect different social progress goals defined in
the SDGs in different parts of the world? Which family
attributes at household impact the effectiveness of the
previously identified family interventions?
This report tries to answer these questions by reviewing
the literature on policy assessment on poverty reduction
(SDG 1), improvements in health (SDG 3), inclusiveness
in education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), youth
employment (SDG 8), and reduction in violence (SDG 16).
The findings show that family-focused interventions are
most often positively evaluated. This may reflect, to some degree, a publication
bias towards significant results. This research also found complementarities and
trade-offs between individual family policies aligned to specific SDGs.

research project called Refugee Voices Japan from
Professor David H. Slater’s Digital Oral Narratives
course at Sophia University. In the class, students
conducted a total of over 200 hours’ worth of interviews with refugees to hear their stories
and relay them on a website*.
From those interviews, students recognized that refugees in Japan are not only intangible
but are also commonly misrepresented despite the capabilities they possess that could
contribute to Japan.
SRSG’s mission is to provide direct support to refugees in Japan and spread awareness
of the situation throughout Japanese society. To do so, SRSG organizes events to gather
students and refugees and create an environment where both parties can interact and
learn from each other, such as visiting the Shinagawa detention center to provide material
and emotional support, delivery of food packages in partnership with Second Harvest
Japan, shipping of personal hygiene packages, assistance in Japanese language instruction
necessary for daily living, translation and research support for refugee application
documents, as well as conducting fundraising events.
SRSG also aims to spread awareness about the refugee issue by planning workshops with
organizations such as Amnesty International or the Japan Association for Refugees, as well
as doing presentations in high schools nationwide to generate discussion among students.
SRSG intends to promote recognition/learning of the reality of refugees here in Japan as
well as gathering support from the general public for the refug ees.

nematodes repelling system using repellent derived from the cel lular
slime mould
Saito Tamao, Professor
Faculty of Science and Technology,
Department of Materials and Life Sciences
【Abstract】
The cellular slime moulds live in the soil. Since many micro-organisms live in the
soil, there are active interspecies chemical communications. It has long been
expected that cellular slime moulds and nematodes would be closely related, as
they live in the same soil and, share a common food source.
We found that the cellular slime moulds repel plant-parasitic nematodes. This
repellent activity is due to the chemical compound(s) released from cellular slime
moulds. We would like to find a way to use this repellent activity to protect
crops from plant-parasitic nematodes, which are diffi cult to control, and thus we
hope to establish a method of plant-parasitic nematodes control that has a low
environmental impact.
【Future prospects】
We would like to develop a novel soil restoration technology based on a
nematode repellent system. At present, nematodes in the soil are killed by
toxic pesticides, but the damage of crops caused by the explosive growth of
the remaining nematodes in the soil is repeated. Therefore, we would like to
develop a novel technology to reduce the density of plant-parasitic nematodes
by continuously suppressing nematode infection in crops. This reduces the use of
pesticides and improves the condition of the soil.

【Abstract】
The hippocampus is regarded as one of the essential brain regions for memory
function. We examined factors and processes that regulate long-term potentiation
(LTP) in hippocampal synaptic transmission, and mechanisms of c ircadian rhythm in
memory performance. Electrophysiological experiments using rodent hippocampal
slice preparations and behavioral experiments using animals revealed that (1) Kv7/
M potassium ion channels are involved in acetylcholine receptor activation-induced
promotion of hippocampal CA1 LTP, (2) inhibition of CA1 LTP in the presence of
pineal hormone melatonin is via the postsynaptic NO signaling pathway, and (3)
circadian variation of spatial memory performance depends on th e melatonin level.
【Future prospects】
We propose that the elucidation of memory function in physiological psychology
facilitates the understanding of essential mental processes in human adaptative
behaviors and will lead to the development of effective support for memory

Droplets While Producing Speech
Takayuki Arai, Professor
Faculty of Science and Technology,
Department of Information and Communication Sciences
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, visualizing the airstream of human breath
during speech production has become extremely important from the viewpoint
of preventing infection. In addition, visualizing droplets and the larger drops
expelled when we speak consonantal sounds may help for the same reason. One
visualization technique is to pass a laser sheet through the dr oplet cloud produced
by a human speaker. However, the laser poses certain health risks for human
beings.
Therefore, we developed an alternative method to passing a laser against a human
body in which we utilize physical models of the human vocal tract. First, we tested
a head-shaped model with a lung model from our previous study to visualize
the exhaled breath during vowel production (with and without a mask). Then,
we implemented an extended version of the anatomical-type vocal-tract model
introduced in our previous study. With this newly developed model, lips are made
of the same flexible material that was used to form the tongue part in the previous
model.
We also attached these lips to another previous model for producing sounds
including /b/. Finally, the lip models were tested to visualize the droplet cloud
including expelled drops present while producing a bilabial plo sive sound.

education. The total enrollment rate in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015, and
the worldwide number of children out of school has dropped by almost half. There has also
been a dramatic increase in literacy rates, and many more girls are in school than ever before.
These are all remarkable successes.
Progress has also been tough in some developing regions due to high levels of poverty,
armed conflicts and other emergencies. In Western Asia and North Africa, ongoing armed
conflict has seen an increase in the number of children out of school. This is a worrying trend.
While Sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest progress in primary school enrollment among all
developing regions – from 52 percent in 1990, up to 78 percent in 2012 – large disparities still
remain. Children from the poorest households are up to four times more likely to be out of
school than those of the richest households. Disparities between rural and urban areas also
remain high.
Achieving inclusive and quality education for all reaffirms the belief that education is one of
the most powerful and proven vehicles for sustainable development. This goal ensures that all

【Abstract】
Respect towards diversity and how it is understood by the
members of dominant groups is the theme of this study, exploring
diversity and fairness advocated in SDGs, within the context of
Japanese society. Traditional multicultural education research in
North America and Europe has largely imposed changes be made
on the part of minorities for acculturation. This study questions
and challenges this, believing that true multiculturalism will be
realized not by enforcing changes only on the oppressed, but also by changing the
consciousness and attitudes of the majority.
Specifically, we developed Japanese Privilege Scale (JPS), which measures the level of
presence of privilege on the part of the Japanese (defined as the racially and ethnically
dominant group in Japan, and documented details pertaining to its development.
In addition, a case study that actually used JPS (providing a micro perspective), as
well as macro studies that explored multiculturalism, globalism and diversity from
socio-political perspectives, are also included in our forthcoming volume, Rethinking
Diversity: Multicultural Education for the Majority which is scheduled to be released
from Sophia University Press in December 2021. In celebrating its publication, a
symposium, co-hosted with Sophia University Research Institute for Languages and
Information (SOLIFIC), will be held on Saturday, December 18, 2021 with Dr. Ryuko
Kubota of the University of British Columbia as our plenary speaker.
【Future prospects】
By developing the Japanese Privilege Scale (JPS), we hoped to contribute to the
development of similar questionnaires in the future for other domains of privilege.
The new Immigration Control Act was enacted in December 2018, and a new
residence status called “specified skills” came into effect in April 2019. As a
result, many people have begun to come to Japan from abroad for the purpose of
permanent residency. In response to this situation, realizing a multicultural society
has become an urgent issue in Japan, yet it is difficult to say to what extent the
Japanese people really understand what this entails in actualizing a multicultural
society and engaging with diversity. Creating a cohesive community with people
who do not speak Japanese and are not familiar with Japanese culture can create
a number of challenges that we have never encountered before. We wish to
address these issues and suggest possible approaches in dealing with them.","Respect towards diversity and how it is understood by the members of dominant groups is the theme of this study, exploring diversity and fairness advocated in SDGs, within the context of Japanese society.", 다양성에 대한 존중과 지배적 집단 구성원이 이를 어떻게 이해하는지가 이 연구의 주제이며 일본 사회의 맥락에서 SDGs에서 옹호하는 다양성과 공정성을 탐구합니다.,4,1

and Thailand
In recent years, two Jesuit schools have been established in Myanmar and Thailand
to offer higher learning to minority students belonging to diverse ethnic, linguistic and
religious groups. These schools are located in areas that are challenged by poverty,
income disparity, inter-ethnic coexistence and lack of educational access, the key
issues of sustainable development addressed by Jesuit education. Sophia University
recently began collaborating with these two institutions to tackle these issues.
On February 5-6, 2018, Taro Komatsu, director of the Center for Global Education
and Discovery and a professor in the Department of Education at Sophia
University, visited the St Aloysius Gonzaga (SAG) Institute of Higher Studies in
Taunggyi, a hilltop town located in the State of Shan, Myanmar. At the request
of the SAG Institute, Professor Komatsu delivered a lecture on “education and
peace” for some 120 students enrolled at the institute, and later discussed issues
pertaining to education with a group of minority students.
On March 2-3, 2018, Yasushi Hirosato, a professor of the Faculty of Global Studies
at Sophia University, visited Xavier Learning Community (XLC) in northern Thailand
with a group of Sophia students. The visit was planned as part of a study tour
that aimed to enhance students’ understanding of social and economic changes
occurring in the regions along the Mekong River.

1157,일본,Sophia,"Ending all discrimination against women and girls is not only a basic human right, it’s crucial
for sustainable future; it’s proven that empowering women and girls helps economic growth
and development.
UNDP has made gender equality central to its work and we’ve seen remarkable progress in
the past 20 years. There are more girls in school now compared to 15 years ago, and most
regions have reached gender parity in primary education.
But although there are more women than ever in the labour market, there are still large
inequalities in some regions, with women systematically denied the same work rights as men.
Sexual violence and exploitation, the unequal division of unpaid care and domestic work, and
discrimination in public office all remain huge barriers. Climate change and disasters continue
to have a disproportionate effect on women and children, as do c onflict and migration.
It is vital to give women equal rights land and property, sexual and reproductive health, and
to technology and the internet. Today there are more women in p ublic office than ever before,
but encouraging more women leaders will help achieve greater ge nder equality.

Nagai Atsuko, Professor
Faculty of Humanities, Department of French Literature
【Abstract】
Claude Cahun (Nantes, France, 1894-Jersey, England, 1954),
photographer and writer, came from a wealthy Jewish family of
Nantes, and had a female artist as her lifelong partner. Cahun’s
body of work was an attempt to be liberated from the moral and material restrictions
imposed by her family, her education, and the social mores of her time. From an analysis
of her photographs (self-portraits and collages) and writings (short stories and essays) a
variety of perspectives emerge with relevance for today’s gender and feminism studies.
To understand the impact of her efforts to express her self-understanding and
be freed from the pressures of gender norms through an ambiguous femininity, I
explore the historical and philosophical significance of her art in the context of
the views of sociologists and sexologists of her time, as well as the views (some
hostile, some sympathetic) of her contemporary surrealist artis ts.
【Future prospects】
Gender is not only a private but also a public issue. It is in this context, the public aspect
of her work, that I analyze English cultural and social representations which appear
frequently in the photographs and writings of Cahun. For example, in a series of selfportraits
she mocks the appropriation of sport by the English state for nationalistic and
militaristic reasons by replacing the masculine image with an image of her exaggerated
femininity. Another example of Cahun’s engagement on a public level is when she wrote
about the absurdity of the criminalization (1918) of the London performance of Oscar
Wild’s Salomé. Thus to fully understand the public aspect of Cahun’s work, as well as
the private, we have to understand the social and cultural meanings of these English
issues, and how she used them to be liberated from gender’s pressures.

Alternative Spring Break (ASB) is an immersive week of hands-on service, leadership-building and relationship-building that is supplemented with education and reflection. Each ASB experience specializes on a particular social issue such as environmental conservation, disaster relief, affordable housing, education, etc. Volunteer teams are matched up with a non-profit agency that provides housing, orientation, training, and then engages the participants in around 40 hours of volunteer service over the course of a week. Prior to departure, ASB participants take part in team activities and meetings to get to know each other and learn about the community partners they will be working with. Participation culminates in a reflection reception in April where teams reunite and share ASB experiences, as well as share ways for continued civic engagement and community outreach. The goal of ASB is to cultivate a sense of social responsibility in student participants, assist them to develop leadership skills, and inspire them to take action to influence positive change in their communities and throughout the world. The experiences are designed to challenge students to think critically about the issues facing the communities they are serving and learning alongside. Being immersed in diverse environments enables them to experience, discuss, and understand social issues in a more personal way than simply hearing about them in the news and discussing them in class.

The United Nations introduced Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being to address a variety of public health issues globally, including maternal mortality, child mortality, communicable diseases, substance abuse, and family planning. The Sustainable Development Goals notably combined 3 of the prior Millennium Development Goals: Improve Maternal Health, Combat HIV/AIDS and Other Diseases, and Reduce Child Mortality into one over-arching goal.

This SDG recognizes the interconnectedness of public health issues and the need for introduction of universal healthcare to all global citizens. Over the past 15 years, notable improvements have been made globally, particularly in child mortality. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic only re-emphasized the need for strong public health infrastructure across the world.","In September 2000, the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",2000년 9월 유엔은 지속 가능한 개발 목표(SDGs)를 채택했습니다.,3,1

Despite being home to many renowned healthcare facilities, healthcare in Texas still does not remain accessible to all. Maternal mortality rates in Texas are some of the highest in the United States. Although the national average is 17.4 deaths per 100,000 births, Texas reported 18.5 deaths per 100,000 in 2018.

In the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, Good Health & Well-Being is an equity issue. In Spring of 2021 for example, ABC News reported that COVID-19 vaccinations were distributed in majority white and high income areas of the city. As described in SDG 2, the lack of equitable access to healthy food sources also contributes to healthcare issues across the region.

To prevent the potential impact on local ecology by alien species of organisms, native species are used as natural enemies to reduce the number of pests. In cooperation with Miaoli District Agricultural Research and Extension Station, Professor Joe-Air Jiang of NTU’s Department of Biomechatronics Engineering has spent 4 years developing an intelligent production system for Mallada basalis (lacewing). In October 2020, the research results were announced in Miaoli District Agricultural Research and Extension Station. Lacewing larvae prey on aphids, mealybugs, mites, among other
smaller pests, and are particularly effective in controlling
pests on strawberry plants, papaya plants, and tee trees.
However, lacewing breeding depends on manual work,
and high density of population may lead to loss caused by
self-predation. Professor Jiang and his team developed
breeding technologies, such as egg extraction solution and
feeding container. Combined with automatic modules and

environmental impact. There are several paths towards that
goal, but one is to focus on the production of sustainable
protein sources. In Europe and Denmark, there is increasing
focus on self-production of proteins, not only regarding security
of supply, but also reduction of soy imports from South
America where there is extensive deforestation and the use
of problematic chemicals. Here, protein from grass is an attractive
alternative. In the project Grass4Food, AAU experts

through the lens of food and agriculture. It offers a
powerful framework for understanding economic
development outcomes.
In her article, “Consumption and Time-Use Effects of
India's Employment Guarantee and Women's
Participation”, Bipasha Maity, Assistant Professor of
Economics, examines the effect of the number of
working days per household under India’s National
Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) on
expenditure patterns, food security, and individual
time use. The paper finds that a greater number of
working days for households translate into higher
food expenditure, especially on items such as dairy,
proteins, and vegetables that are likely to improve
children’s nutritional status. This is probably
facilitated by the greater participation of women
relative to men in the programme. Moreover, greater
adult participation in NREGA raises the time spent by
younger girls in school; importantly, there is a fall in
domestic chores as women’s major engagement.
However, older boys are found to substitute for
adults in agricultural work. The increased
engagement of boys in agricultural work is a plausible
unintended consequence of the programme.",A course on “Economics of Agricultural Transformation” looks at economic development through the lens of food and agriculture.," ""농업 전환의 경제학"" 과정은 식량과 농업의 렌즈를 통해 경제 발전을 살펴봅니다.",1,1

Prices
Click to Read Paper
In his paper, “The Distributional Impact of Climate
Change: Why Food Prices Matter”, Bharat
Ramaswami, Professor of Economics, analyzed the
impact of agricultural productivity losses stemming
from climate change in an economy without frictions.
The question that is addressed is as follows: the firstorder
GDP impacts are expected to be small but the
poor have higher food budget shares and food prices
will rise. So how do distributional impacts diverge
from the GDP impact? The paper considers two
major sets of comparative statics: the effect of trade
and the effect of economic growth. It shows that the
percentage loss of income for the landless is six times
the GDP impact in a closed economy. Trade halves
this effect and economic growth moderates it
substantially. Despite the rise in food prices, nearly all
farmers lose from climate change.","In our series of letters from Indian journalists, film-maker and columnist Sharmila Tagore looks at the impact of climate change on food prices.",인도 언론인이자 영화 제작자이자 칼럼니스트인 Sharmila Tagore가 보낸 편지 시리즈에서 기후 변화가 식량 가격에 미치는 영향을 살펴봅니다.,2,1

Policy on COVID-19 Mortality
Pulapre Balakrishnan, Professor of Economics, coauthored
an article “The Importance of Investing in a
Public Health System: Evidence from COVID-19
Mortality”. While the response to COVID-19 by the
Government of India has been more or less uniform
across the country, the death rate has varied across
the states. The article investigates the possible role
of health policy in the determination of this rate.
Using three different measures of the death rate,
they found that measures of death rate were
strongly related to health expenditure as a share of
the gross domestic product but hardly at all to public
health infrastructure. This can be interpreted as a
sign of the role of the public health system—
comprising medical personnel, infrastructure and
protocols—in the prevention of death, with health
expenditure as a key determinant of its effectiveness.
This implies that some of the mortality from
COVID-19 was policy-induced, and therefore was
avoidable. Second, assuring health security to the

restructuring of the spending priorities of the states.",Professor Balakrishnan's article has been published in the journal Environmental Research Letters., Balakrishnan 교수의 논문은 Environmental Research Letters 저널에 게재되었습니다.,3,1

and Women's Health: Implications of the Practice of
Menstrual Restrictions in Nepal”, she uses microdata
from Nepal where these rituals are widely
prevalent. Similar restrictions, also practised
around the time of childbirth, are based on the
assumption that women are ritually impure during
these phases of their lives. They find that women
who face any menstrual restriction are also more
likely to give birth at home and receive assistance
only from untrained individuals during childbirth,
which increases the risk of maternal mortality. They
also find that only the strictest menstrual
restrictions are associated with a decline in
subjective well-being. These findings indicate that
menstrual restriction related rituals can have
persistent negative implications on women’s

compensated by cutting down the share of time

Domestic Violence – The
Cost of Doing Nothing
Ground-breaking research from the Gender
and Public Policy cluster of the Whitaker
Institute at NUI Galway, on the economic
cost of domestic violence in low and
middle-income countries has been pivotal
to developing new legislation and policies
to protect women in Egypt, South Sudan
and Vietnam. Women experience domestic
violence behind closed doors; however, its
impact reaches beyond the individual and
their family, having serious consequences for
national economies. For example, costing
research, led by NUI Galway, found that lost
productivity, in days, was equivalent to a 4.5%
reduction in the female working population
in Ghana in 2019. For individual women
survivors, domestic violence poses a drain on
household resources through out-of-pocket
costs to access services to treat and mitigate
the consequences of violence. In Vietnam,
women survivors spent approximately 25% of
their annual income on these expenses. As
countries strive to expand women’s economic
participation to accelerate economic growth
and eradicate poverty, this loss is substantial.","The economic cost of domestic violence in low and middle-income countries has been pivotal to developing new legislation and policies to protect women in Egypt, South Sudan and Vietnam."," 저소득 및 중간 소득 국가에서 가정 폭력으로 인한 경제적 비용은 이집트, 남수단 및 베트남에서 여성을 보호하기 위한 새로운 법안과 정책을 개발하는 데 중추적 역할을 했습니다.",1,1
