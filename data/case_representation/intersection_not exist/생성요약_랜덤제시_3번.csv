Enabling and broadening access to university, particularly for students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds, is a strategic imperative. To achieve this, we have adopted an integrated approach across the student life cycle, partnering with various stakeholders to identify and nurture talent from high school through to graduation. A range of initiatives include the After School Programme (ASP) in partnership with the Gauteng Department of Education; a strategic partnership between the Faculty of Education and the National Department of Basic Education to recruit unemployed youth with good matric passes in scarce-skills subjects; and the development of virtual platforms to support recruitment of local and international students. The ASP provides support to Grade 10 to 12 learners in the Mamelodi area, for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM subjects), and is coupled to a Teacher Mentorship Programme offered for Grade 4 to 10 mathematics and science teachers. Within the ASP, the range of offerings include weekend classes; self-paced tutorials using e-learning software; spring and winter schools; and training in life skills, study methods and computer literacy.

regardless of political or environmental persuasions, were keen to
embrace new energy technologies and also want those who can’t
afford solar, or aren’t allowed to install it themselves, to benefit. The

The health consequences of child labour are ambiguous. On the one
hand, heavy lifting, using dangerous tools and handling fertilisers
may impact negatively on health. On the other, child labour could
be used to achieve a minimal subsistence standard, without which
the child could experience deteriorating health. Previous empirical
studies are inconclusive because, until now, existing data sources
could not disentangle between different activities performed by child
workers. To establish how work is related to health, it is essential
to know what activities are being performed. RMIT Researcher
Alberto Posso’s project, ‘Health Consequences of Child Labour’,
fills this gap with a unique child labour survey conducted in Peru
by its Government and the International Labour Organisation (ILO).
The econometric results suggest that children doing non-hazardous
work are less likely to have health problems than non-working
children. Conversely, those that work in hazardous activities are
potentially more likely to exhibit health concerns. The results give
impetus to the notion that child work increases the total resources
available for households, which can improve child health. Therefore,
it is over and above this potential increment in resources that some
hazardous activities worsen working children’s health.","Alberto Posso, ‘Health Consequences of Child Labour’"," Alberto Posso, '아동 노동의 건강 결과'",8,3

It was noted that trust is the glue that binds social networks, and
social networks and feelings of inclusion are important predictors for
mental health and wellbeing. The research underlines how it is not
the diversity itself that is the problem, but is the lack of trust that often
accompanies it. The study showed that for a diverse neighbourhood
and a homogenous neighbourhood - where both had similar levels
of trust - then mental health was generally better in the diverse
neighbourhood. Policies to increase bonding and social capital and
promote awareness of the benefits of diversity should help to build
trust and reduce the negative effect of diversity on mental health.",Researchers at the University of Sydney have found a link between ethnic diversity and mental health., 시드니 대학교(University of Sydney)의 연구원들은 인종적 다양성과 정신 건강 사이의 연관성을 발견했습니다.,10,3

RMIT demonstrated sustainability leadership by leading the
Melbourne Renewable Energy Project 2 (MREP2). Building on
the success of the first MREP 1 project, RMIT and six partners
used their combined purchasing power to source wind energy
produced in regional Victoria.
The group consisted of RMIT and six partners, who together
are purchasing 110 GWh of renewable electricity per annum.
This is equivalent to providing renewable energy to power more
than 22,000 Australian households every year. It will reduce
greenhouse gas pollution by 123,000 tonnes a year, which
is comparable to taking nearly 28,000 cars off the road.
Following a rigorous procurement process in line with RMIT
policy and probity procedures, the MREP2 deal was signed in
June 2020 to source wind energy produced at the Yaloak South
Wind Farm near Ballan. The MREP2 deal sees a further 22
RMIT buildings being powered by 100 per cent carbon neutral
electricity from January 2021. This is RMIT’s second large-scale
renewable energy contract to date.",RMIT is the first university in Australia to be powered entirely by renewable energy., RMIT는 전적으로 재생 가능 에너지로 전력을 공급받는 호주 최초의 대학입니다.,7,3

In 2020, RMIT achieved an end-use energy intensity of
0.481 GJ/m2, which represents a 39 per cent decrease in
end-use energy intensity from the 2007 energy baseline. This
result was significantly influenced by COVID-19 and the move to
remote learning, as well as the previously completed large-scale
energy efficiency program, renewable energy contracting, solar
PV rollout and the recent focus on building optimisation.
RMIT continues to operate onsite co-generation and
tri-generation plants at the City and Bundoora West campuses.
RMIT has installed solar PV across the rooftops of the University
building portfolio, maximising the use of on-site renewable
energy generation wherever practical. Solar installation sites were
selected with the assistance of RMIT Masters students from
the School of Property, Construction and Project Management.
During 2020, RMIT generated over 19GWh of electricity onsite.

In 2020, researchers at RMIT patented technology that could
help in driving renewable energy by upcycling the by-products
of sewerage treatment. A research project lead by Associate
Professor Kalpit Shah developed a technology which uses a
material derived from biosolids (one by-product of sewerage
treatment) to spark chemical reactions which produce hydrogen
from biogas (another by-product). This technology allows for
hydrogen production to take place on wastewater treatment
sites, with all materials sourced internally.
The hydrogen industry is an exciting prospect for the international
community, as when used as a fuel, hydrogen combines
with oxygen to produce water as a waster product, rather
than carbon dioxide. In countries such as Japan, hydrogen
is already being used to fuel machines including cars, buses,
and household heating systems. However, current hydrogen
extraction techniques proposed for Australia come with large
environmental and monetary costs. This exciting development
allows for clean hydrogen production and maximum extraction
of resources from waste products – a key part of the transition
to a circular economy.
The technology, which includes a specialised reactor designed
by RMIT, also captures carbon emissions from biogas and
biosolids before it reaches the atmosphere. Instead of increasing
the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, this
carbon can instead be utilised – for example as a fertiliser or as
energy storage. The promotion of this new technology sparked a
strong industry response in Australia and internationally, including
multiple investment and partnership inquiries to work towards
commercialisation.","RMIT researchers have developed a technology which could help in driving renewable energy by upcycling the by-products of sewerage treatment.

In September 2020, RMIT in partnership with the University
of Adelaide and The Australian Housing and Urban Research
Institute (AHURI) contributed to a report titled ‘Warm, cool
and energy-affordable housing policy solutions for lowincome
renters.’ The report seeks to examine the issue of
energy hardship with low-income renters., Energy hardship is
experienced when people face financial insecurity surrounding
energy prices, and this can often result in them being unable to
afford to heat or cool their homes. During heat waves or cold
winters, this can have particularly devastating psychological
and physical health impacts.
In Australia, those who are socially disadvantaged and on
low incomes are particularly vulnerable to energy hardship.
The report found that vulnerable groups (such as those with
little or no income, people with ongoing health conditions, and
those facing other entrenched disadvantages) face especially
dire energy hardship, and often live in poor-quality dwellings.
The investigative panel also found that energy hardship is unique
for renters, due to their lack of immediate control over improving
the thermal efficiency of the dwellings where they live. Finally,
the report stated that although one blanket set of governmental
regulations of policy will solve this complex problem, a set of
comprehensive measures, including changes to building codes,
material assistance to vulnerable households, and investment
in public housing are needed.",4,4,7,3
349,호주,RMIT,"5. Solar chimney
Solar chimneys, which have been in existence for thousands
of years, are a passive cooling system which use natural heat
transfer to cool buildings. Hot air rises due to convection and
cool air rushes to fill the gap, creating zero-energy cooling.
Solar chimneys help warm dwellings in winter and cool them
in summer, using natural energy and processes. Despite being
used for millennia by ancient civilisations, the use of solar
chimneys disappeared in modern Western architecture and
design. However, this ancient technology is coming back into
relevance as the modern world looks for renewable technologies.
They are also incredibly cost-efficient, one solar chimney can
halve energy costs.
In 2020, RMIT partnered with the City of Kingston to prototype
an efficient and fire-safe solar chimney and found that it
extended the safe evacuation time from two to fourteen minutes.
According to researcher Dr Long Shi, solar chimneys also suck
smoke out of the building in the case of fire, reducing the risk of
smoke inhalation. This research revealed that not only are solar
chimneys a viable means of renewable heating and cooling,
they also reduce the fire risks associated with modern homes.
This research has led to a new design standard and guide
for optimised solar chimneys – and has created a buzz in
architecture and design media. It also triggered an enquiry
about the system from a European consultant, a book invitation
from Springer Publishing on solar chimney design, and a
nomination as a finalist in the 2020 Australian Engineering
Excellence Awards.",Here are five things you may not have known about solar chimneys.,태양 굴뚝에 대해 몰랐을 수도 있는 5가지 사항이 있습니다.,7,3

solar energy to power a regional city
A new RMIT study has found Australia’s government-owned
airports could produce enough electricity to power 136,000
homes if they had large-scale rooftop solar systems installed.
Researchers at RMIT’s School of Science compared electricity
generated by residential solar panels in a regional city to the
potential green energy production of 21 leased federal airports.
They found if large-scale solar systems were installed at Federal
airports across Australia, they could generate enough electricity
to supply 136,000 homes, while offsetting 152,000 tonnes of
greenhouse gas emissions annually. This research shows the
value of focusing renewable energy efforts on large centralised
rooftop solar systems and highlights that airports are ideal for
solar panels but are not currently being used to their full potential
– many Australian airports are without adequate solar systems.
Researchers also stressed the need for energy policies to include
a plan for installing solar panels at airports.
Previous studies have deemed airports as great solar generators
but the RMIT research goes further by precisely modelling the
use of large-scale systems. The findings could also be extended
to assess the solar potential of other sites, such as large
commercial buildings, warehouses or distribution centres.","Australian airports could generate enough solar energy to power a regional city, a new RMIT study has found.

of COVID impact
The annual Australian Digital Inclusion Index provides a snapshot
of Australians’ online participation using the measures of access,
affordability and digital ability.
Published by Telstra, RMIT and Swinburne University, the
2020 report showed a high level of digital inequality persists
in Australia with many groups continuing to miss out on the
benefits of being online.
While there were improvements in some areas, the report
also revealed the rate of improvement has slowed. The digital
inequality highlighted in the report was made more pronounced
by the social and economic impact of COVID-19 and showed
steps will need to be taken to ensure that those facing financial
hardship do not fall into the digital divide. Detailed in the report
is the impact of COVID-19 on students in low-income family
households, finding it has been highly disruptive.
Australia has just under four million primary and secondary
school students with about 800,000 from households with
a yearly income under $35,000. These households record an
Index score more than ten points below the national average
and 15.5 points lower than families with school-aged children
in other income brackets.
They often lack access to technology and suitable devices,

internet speeds using a single optical chip
Researchers from RMIT, Monash and Swinburne universities
have achieved the world’s fastest internet data speed –
enough to download 1000 High Definition movies in a split
second – using a single optical chip. The ground-breaking
results published in Nature Communications could fast-track
Australia’s telecommunications capacity and that of other
countries also struggling with demand on internet infrastructure.
The research team led by Monash University’s Dr Bill Corcoran,
RMIT’s Distinguished Professor Arnan Mitchell and Swinburne’s
Professor David Moss recorded a data speed of 44.2 Terabits
per second (Tbps) from a single light source. These speeds
were achieved by attaching their new device to existing fibreoptic
technology, used across Australia’s National Broadband
Network (NBN). The future ambition of the project is to scale up
the current transmitters from hundreds of gigabytes per second
to tens of terabytes per second without increasing size, weight or
cost. Long-term, the team hopes to create integrated photonic
chips that could enable this sort of data rate to be achieved
across existing optical fibre links with minimal cost.
Initially, these would be attractive for ultra-high-speed
communications between data centres. Once the technology
became sufficiently low cost and compact it could potentially
be deployed for commercial use by the general public in
cities across the world.",All images are copyrighted., 모든 이미지는 저작권이 있습니다.,9,3

Built Environment Global Career
The RMIT webinar Transformation for a Sustainable Built
Environment looked at how digital technology and data is
impacting what and how we design, build and operate in the
built environment. The webinar featured speakers from RMIT
and alumni working in the built environment in Europe, who
shared their insights on how the next generation of sector
leaders can implement sustainable building and design solutions.
Besides stimulating global economic recovery in response
to COVID-19, government investment in construction and
infrastructure also offers the built environment sector an
opportunity to respond with sustainable building and design
solutions. According to RMIT experts and alumni, now is not
only the time for the sector to think about addressing climate
change and energy challenges, but also the right moment
to apply an inclusive human-centric approach.
COVID-19 has been a driver of change for more sustainable
forms of transport in cities according to David Castro, Structural
Engineer and Associate Director at Arup in Madrid, Spain.
According to Castro, the pandemic catalysed rapid approaches
to how we address urban mobility and showed that cities can
drastically change without too much disruption. The discussion
also looked at how governments around the world were investing
in construction and infrastructure to stimulate the economy,
with a big focus in Europe on green infrastructure and
refurbishments to improve the efficiency of buildings.","The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) hosted an international conference in Melbourne, Australia, on the future of the built environment.", Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology(RMIT)는 건축 환경의 미래에 대해 호주 멜버른에서 국제 회의를 주최했습니다.,9,3

strengthens 3D-printed titanium
RMIT researchers worked on a collaborative project to develop
new titanium-copper alloys for 3D printing. The alloys could
kickstart a new range of high-performance alloys for different
applications, such as medical devices and aerospace. Current
titanium alloys used in additive manufacturing often cool and
bond together in column-shaped crystals during the 3D printing
process, making them prone to cracking or distortion. But the
new titanium alloy with copper appears to have solved this
problem, printing with excellent properties and without any
special process control or additional treatment.
Professor Mark Easton from RMIT University’s School of
Engineering noted a fully equiaxed grain structure, meaning
the crystal grains had grown equally in all directions to form
a strong bond, instead of in columns, which can lead to weak
points liable to cracking. Alloys with this microstructure can
withstand much higher forces and will be much less likely to
have defects, such as cracking or distortion, during manufacture.
The collaborative project involved leading researchers in the area
of alloy composition and grain microstructure from RMIT, CSIRO,
the University of Queensland and the Ohio State University.","A new range of high-performance alloys could kickstart a new range of high-performance alloys for different applications, such as medical devices and aerospace.", 새로운 범위의 고성능 합금은 의료 기기 및 항공우주와 같은 다양한 응용 분야를 위한 새로운 범위의 고성능 합금을 촉발할 수 있습니다.,9,3

among older Australians
For many older Australians, using information and
communication technologies (ICT) may be a daunting exercise.
Going online is often perceived as a risky endeavour, and this
perception can prevent these older adults from extracting the
full benefit of life with technology such as being able to access
government and health-related services, shop and transact
online, engage in learning opportunities, share meaningful
moments with loved ones, and access useful information.
As a result, digital exclusion has become a significant driver
of social and economic inequality. Improving the digital inclusion
of these vulnerable Australians provides the backbone to
reducing inequality by improving their wellbeing and their
access to resources.
To help increase the digital inclusion of older Australians,
the School of Economics, Finance and Marketing at RMIT
has partnered with the University of the Third Age, and the City
of Whittlesea to create the Shaping Connections program.
In a project funded by the Australian Communications
Consumer Action Network, the first stage of this project involved
understanding and mapping the perceived risks Australians
experience with ICT. During the second half of 2020, RMIT
researchers conducted 22 interviews with Australians aged
65 and over. This stage of the research has detected five types
(and 23 sub-types) of perceived risks that create hurdles for the
adoption and use of ICT amongst older consumers. Mapping
these risks was an important step in reducing digital exclusion.
The project will continue in 2021 with a survey to be sent to
the 40,000 seniors, members of the U3A Network Victoria,
to help quantify the mapped risks and co-design workshops
used to provide seniors with strategies to better manage and
overcome these perceived risks.","RMIT's School of Economics, Finance and Marketing has been working with the University of the Third Age and the City of Whittlesea to improve the digital inclusion of older Australians.","RMIT의 경제, 금융 및 마케팅 대학은 제3시대 대학 및 휘틀시 시와 협력하여 노년의 호주인의 디지털 통합을 개선하고 있습니다.",10,3

intellectual disabilities in the criminal
justice system
RMIT’s Centre for Innovative Justice (CIJ) has created
a new online resource designed to help people with cognitive
impairment and intellectual disabilities receive fairer treatment
in Victoria’s criminal justice system.
This critical new resource has been designed with input from
people with disability and lived experience of the criminal justice
system to help transform the way people with disability are
treated in the court system. CIJ Associate Director, Research,
Innovation and Reform Stan Winford said while people with a
disability are over-represented in our criminal justice system,
they are rarely recognised or responded to appropriately and
on the whole are under-supported.
The primary focus of the Supporting Justice website is to help
lawyers and court professionals learn how to recognise the signs
of disability in the first instance, gain an understanding of the
criminal justice system experience of people with a disability,
and offer appropriate needs-based support that will ultimately
lead to fairer outcomes.
The website provides practical resources for lawyers, judicial
officers and court professionals to better respond to people
with autism spectrum disorder, cognitive impairment, intellectual
disability and dual disability. It also connects support workers,
people with disability and their carers with resources to help with
seeking legal advice, preparing for court and getting support
while at court.
People with a cognitive impairment are severely over-represented
in the criminal justice system with one study by Corrections
Victoria, finding that 42 per cent of male prisoners and 33 per
cent of female prisoners have an acquired brain injury. This
compares to less than 3 per cent of the general population.
The website is part of the broader Supporting Justice program
– a systems change project which works with people with lived
experience, as well as key stakeholders. to improve the justice
system’s responses to mental health and disability.","The Supporting Justice website provides practical resources for lawyers, judicial officers and court professionals to better respond to people with autism spectrum disorder, cognitive impairment, intellectual disability and dual disability."," 사법 지원 웹사이트는 변호사, 사법 공무원 및 법원 전문가가 자폐 스펙트럼 장애, 인지 장애, 지적 장애 및 이중 장애를 가진 사람들에게 더 잘 대응할 수 있도록 실용적인 리소스를 제공합니다.",10,3

On average, landscapes that were dominated by grey infrastructure were 1.5°C warmer compared to landscapes where grey infrastructure was absent. Although landscapes dominated by hard surfaces heated up slower during the morning, they cooled down less during the night, leading to heat island effects.

It is particularly important to understand the impacts ofa high penetration of wind power on an electricity market that is alreadyhighly influenced by seasonal hydro power availability. Supportedby researchers at the Electric Power Optimization Centre at theUniversity, this research aims to understand where the optimal locationsto build wind capacity are in order to maximise renewable electricityand minimise negative impacts on electricity prices. The researchersfound that, for some locations, it is daily random deviations from theaverage that have a more significant correlation with electricity pricesthan the seasonal patterns.

The onlyway to do that has been using sensors inserted by catheters throughthe arteries to the heart – an invasive and painful procedure. Under theScience for Technological Innovation (SfTI) programme, researcherDr Avinash Malik, and his team Tommy Peng and Dr Mark Trew, havebeen working on a solution to this problem using a data chip to finetuneinternal devices. The modelling does two things. First, it translates theECG readings into the probable EGM readings at the heart level, so thecardiologist can finetune the device without invasive surgery. Secondly, italso allows a cardiologist to predict what effect various medications willhave on the patient’s heart rhythm, which previously required trial anderror. The computer modelling, which uses machine learning, is based ondata from collaboration with Associate Researcher Laura Bear from theIHU-LIRYC research lab in Bordeaux, France.

However, no air temperature data is available for the Campbelltown City Council area as official weather stations can only be found outside the local government area. The heat sensor project allows us to gauge detailed information into the micro climate of the region.” Dr Sebastian Pfautsch, Environment and Sustainability Research Theme Fellow Researchers launched a heat sensor project to measure the air temperature in 110 locations across Campbelltown LGA. The project uncovered a significant warming trend from forested to urbanised locations. On average, landscapes that were dominated by grey infrastructure were 1.5°C warmer compared to landscapes where grey infrastructure was absent. Although landscapes dominated by hard surfaces heated up slower during the morning, they cooled down less during the night, leading to heat island effects.

757,미국,California,"The University of California’s Investment Office is responsible for stewarding the roughly $126 billion in employee retirement savings, campus endowments and working capital. The office works to ensure that the more than 320,000 people currently receiving a UC pension get paid, that UC can continue to fund research and scholarships throughout the UC system and that UC campuses and medical centers earn the best possible return on their investments. For several years, UC has been a leader among large institutional investors in incorporating climate change-related risks and opportunities into its overall investment strategy. For example, in 2015, UC sold investments in companies earning revenue from the exploration and extraction of thermal coal and oil sands, due to its assessment that the risks associated with those investments outweighed the potential benefits to UC’s portfolio. In 2019, UC took another step away from fossil fuels, deciding to sell holdings in companies that earn more than 10 percent of their revenues from exploring and extracting oil, gas and thermal coal. UC sold investments in these fossil fuel reserveowning companies in order to “de-risk” the university’s $13.6 billion endowment. As a result of this decision, the potential fossil fuel reserves emissions of UC’s investment portfolio have been reduced by 99.5 percent, from 5,560,446 million metric tons of CO2 e in 2018 to 26,507 million metric tons of CO2 e in 2019 (post-sale), according to calculations made by MSCIusing publicly available information about the size of fossil fuel reserves of the companies. (MSCI is the Investment Office’s climate and data analytics provider.) Additionally, as the first university to sign on to the Principles for Responsible Investment and the Montreal Carbon Pledge, UC annually measures the carbon footprint of its public equities investment portfolio to evaluate which of its investments have the highest emissions and therefore may be exposing UC’s portfolio to greater climate risk. Calculations are made on UC Investments’ portfolio of public equities based on weightings of the relative size of equity holdings. As of November 2018, the carbon footprint for the $46.3 billion combined University of California Retirement Plan, General Endowment Pool and Total Return Investment Pool public equity portfolios was 7,114,301 tons of CO2 e, or 153.6 tons of CO2 e per $1 million. The industrials and materials sectors account for a combined 38.7 percent, and the utilities sector accounts for 31 percent of the carbon emissions footprint of the UC Investments portfolio. Also in 2019, UC made significant progress toward its fiveyear 2020 goal of investing $1 billion targeting clean energy solutions to fuel the world’s future. UC’s commitment of over $725 million over the past four years has contributed to the installation of 4.9 gigawatts of solar and wind generation in the U.S., Canada, Japan, India, the United Kingdom and Mexico. UC’s pro rata share of those installations is approximately 500 megawatts.

855,호주,Charles Sturt,"Charles Sturt’s Institute for Land, Water and
Society and Agricultural, Environmental and
Veterinary Sciences studied diadromous fish or
those that migrate between fresh and marine
waters. These researchers found that they are
among the most vulnerable species. These fish
need to move between fresh water and the sea,
so any obstruction to migration can block access
to critical habitat areas. The Mekong River Basin
covers an area of 795,000 square kilometres
and drains water from six countries in Southeast
Asia. The Lower Mekong Basin is experiencing
an unprecedented boom in river development,
with hundreds of existing and planned dams
and irrigation schemes being installed. Charles
Sturt reviewed over 1,000 Mekong fish species
to identify evidence for diadromy. Some of the
diadromous fish are economically important and
are distributed among all Mekong countries. Many
of these species migrate relatively long distances,
connecting with the Mekong estuary and the sea
to complete their life cycles. River development will
impact them. They need to be considered in holistic
ecosystem planning to prevent declines while also
meeting food and energy demands in the region.",Researchers at the University of Adelaide have identified fish species at risk from river development in the Mekong River Basin., 애들레이드 대학(University of Adelaide)의 연구원들은 메콩 강 유역(Mekong River Basin)의 강 개발로 인해 위험에 처한 어종을 확인했습니다.,9,3

【Abstract】
The growing urgency of environmental and energy problems has drawn attention
to fossil fuel replacing energy sources including high hopes for solar cell
technology. Current installations primarily use expensive silicon-based solar cells,
generating interest in inexpensive and highly stable alternatives. Over the past ten
years perovskite solar cells have rapidly improved achieving a maximum power
conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25% and cheaper production as high quality
manufacturing has become more convenient making perovskite solar cells a strong
contender for the next generation of solar cells.
In terms of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, higher power
generation rates and reduced costs contribute to Goal Number 7 (“Affordable
and Clean Energy”) and the carbon emission impact of the technology contributes
to Goal Number 13 (“Climate Action”). In this research we seek to improve
the reliability and safety of perovskite solar cells through studying designs and
compositions of various perovskite compounds.
【Future prospects】
As power generation efficiency improves, practical applications will increase for
perovskite solar cells. Perovskite solar cells can be fabricated on fl exible substrate
and have a broad array of use cases. Issues that remain to be solved include low
stability and their lead content. Overcoming these obstacles will result in a wider
market for perovskite solar cells. In addition to solar cells, the photoluminescent
characteristics of perovskite shows promise in optical applicat ions.

【Abstract】
The purpose of this project is to develop engines that do not emit carbon dioxide
(CO2) as a way to help reduce the environmental impact and energy policy set forth
in the SDGs. Ammonia (NH3) plays an important role as one of the basic raw materials
for making a wide variety of chemical products around us, and is widely used in
home appliances, construction materials, medical supplies, etc., as well as nylon and
automobile parts. In recent years, ammonia has been attracting attention as a storage
and transportation medium (energy carrier) for hydrogen energy, which is used to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions. On the other hand, since ammonia is a carbonfree
fuel that does not emit carbon dioxide when burned, there is an urgent need to
develop ammonia engines. However, ammonia is diffi cult to burn because of its low
combustion performance (high ignition temperature, narrow fl ame holding range, slow
combustion speed), nitrogen oxide emissions, and corrosiveness, therefore research
is being conducted from the aspects of thermal engineering, environmental chemistry,
materials science, and precision engineering. We have developed a prototype engine
with a high compression ratio equipped with a sub-combustion chamber, glow plugs,
and spark plugs, and are conducting demonstration tests to ensure environmental
performance and reliability.
【Future prospects】
Japan currently relies on fossil fuels for 93% of its primary energy supply, and in
order to achieve an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050, Japan will need
to import large quantities of hydrogen and ammonia from overseas. In order to
achieve an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050, we need to import large
amounts of hydrogen and ammonia from overseas, and we believe that the
technology to burn the imported ammonia has great social signifi cance and ripple
eff ects. For example, by combining a carbon-free engine with a power generation
device, we expect to develop a small-scale power generation system. In addition,
ammonia, which liquefi es easily at 8.5 atmospheres at room temperature, is easy
to transport and manage, and is expected to be used in power ge neration projects
in developing countries and for reducing carbon dioxide emissio ns.",Researchers at the University of Tokyo are developing a carbon-free engine that does not emit carbon dioxide as a way to help reduce the environmental impact and energy policy set forth in the SDGs., 도쿄 대학의 연구원들은 SDGs에 명시된 환경 영향과 에너지 정책을 줄이는 데 도움이 되는 방법으로 이산화탄소를 배출하지 않는 무탄소 엔진을 개발하고 있습니다.,7,3

and the improvement of knowledge and skills of foreign caregivers and nurses so
that people with foreign roots can access medical care with peace of mind.
In addition, while their communication skills in Japanese are inadequate, they
have to cope with the dialect spoken by the elderly and are having trouble
understanding the dialect. In order to solve this problem, we have developed a
dialect dictionary application for Okinawa and Wakayama and are releasing it on
a trial basis on the Diversity Channel.

people with foreign roots work safely and healthily in Japan.
The language barrier is a major problem when people with foreign roots visit
medical institutions in Japan.
In addition, there is a big communication barrier when working. In order to solve
these problems, we are developing tools to support the dissemination of information
and the improvement of knowledge and skills of foreign caregivers and nurses so
that people with foreign roots can access medical care with peace of mind.
In addition, while their communication skills in Japanese are inadequate, they
have to cope with the dialect spoken by the elderly and are having trouble
understanding the dialect. In order to solve this problem, we have developed a
dialect dictionary application for Okinawa and Wakayama and are releasing it on
a trial basis on the Diversity Channel.
【Future prospects】
Anyone can view the published information on our website, and we would like
to spread the information to medical and nursing facilities in Japan. We have
extended the dialect dictionary application for Okinawa and Wakayama, and
improved it into an application specialized for medical and nursing care. We will
conduct a demonstration experiment and aim to put it to practical use. We would
also like to try to create dialect dictionary apps for other regions as well. We want
to provide a safe and secure working environment for foreign workers so that they
do not have to suff er from language barriers that prevent them from receiving the
full range of medical and nursing services that they are entitl ed to.
We hope that we can contribute in some small way to a society that respects
multiple languages and is open to diff erent languages and cultures.

“Equity” is an organization that mainly discusses discrimination in gen eral, including sexism,
speciesism, and racism at Sophia University. The group is not bound by the framework of
each type of discrimination, but focuses on the intersectionality of discrimination. Its main
activities are to give presentations on topics of interest, such as sexism and racism, and to
deepen mutual interest and discussion based on these presentati ons.
The group contributes to SDG No. 5 “Gender Equality” and 10 “Reduced Equality” by
deepening the fundamental understanding of social issues related to discrimination and
sharing this information on SNS. The representative of the orga nization has stated that even
within the small community of Sophia University, the level of concern about discrimination
varies from person to person, but learning little by little what is happening and what kind
of discrimination exists is required.

Sophia University inherits the Jesuit educational spirit “Men and Women for
Others, with Others”. We believe that the existence of all humanity is good and
all are equal in dignity. Therefore, it is our ambition that the entire student body
works diligently while employing the best of their abilities, so they can be useful
human resources to others.
In addition to the University’s philosophy, based on the “Convention on the Rights
of Persons with Disabilities” adopted by the United Nations General Assembly
in 2006, we will eliminate unfair and discriminatory treatment of students with
disabilities while promoting study and research by discussing w ith each student the
best course of action. Sophia University will provide reasonable accommodation*
to students who require extra assistance.
In addition, all students will deepen their understanding of disabilities, practice
actions with the perspective of the individual with a disability in mind, and aim for
a symbiotic society.

Solar Panels at various locations provide some renewable energy to power campus. At Parking Structure 1, four rows of solar panels are designed to produce 227 kW of energy, enough to supply the energy needs for the entire structure. This makes Parking Structure 1 a net-zero energy building. At the Engineering and Computer Science North (ECSN) building, solar panels on the roof provide 1.2 kW of energy to be used in the Renewable Energy and Vehicular Technology lab. Solar panels at the UT Dallas Research and Operations Center (ROC) provide charging for faculty golf carts, allowing them to drive to the main campus without emissions. Installed in 2021, these 4-kilowatt panels are connected to batteries that are capable of storing 15 kilowatts, which provides for nighttime charging. Lastly, solar thermal panels on the roof of the Student Services Building (SSB) heat the building’s water, decreasing the amount of electricity needed for the building’s operations.",The University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas) is one of the first campuses in the United States to install solar panels on its buildings., University of Texas at Dallas(UT Dallas)는 건물에 태양광 패널을 설치한 미국 최초의 캠퍼스 중 하나입니다.,7,3

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world faced unprecedented challenges in the economic sector, with about 1.6 billion people at risk of losing their livelihoods.

To solve the social and environmental issues that economic challenges can cause, SDG 8 is intersectional in nature. Rather than just focusing on unchecked economic growth, this goal strives to address inequalities for disabled people and underrepresented groups in the workplace. Other targets include protecting labor rights, promoting sustainable tourism, and improving global resource efficiency.

Currently, over half of the world’s population lives in urbanized areas. However, cities account for 70% of carbon emissions and 60% of resource use across the world. With high levels of economic development, construction, and infrastructure services, cities can contribute huge amounts of pollution and destroy natural land.

Past the environmental impact of cities, many social inequalities are also often represented in cities. When analyzing cities, we also must contemplate where waste is disposed of, the quality of schools in different regions of the city, and who is forced out of their homes due to gentrification. In building Sustainable Cities and Communities, we must find a way to develop transportation infrastructure, house everyone in a safe and sanitary living environment, and provide essential services —all in a sustainable way.","In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker, and columnist Ahmed Rashid looks at the challenges of building Sustainable Cities and Communities."," 아프리카 언론인, 영화 제작자, 칼럼니스트인 Ahmed Rashid가 보낸 일련의 편지에서 지속 가능한 도시 및 지역사회 건설의 도전 과제를 살펴봅니다.",11,3

For submission of our 2019 AASHE report, UT Dallas conducted a comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions inventory. Student Eco Reps were a critical part of collecting and analyzing the data for the report and it was reviewed externally by an energy engineer from the University of North Texas. From the baseline year of 2017 to the performance year of 2018, UTD had a 0% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions output. The Office of Sustainability hopes that this inventory will serve as a baseline and motivator for future emissions action.

campus. The building design uses a double-wall
construction with brick cladding and AAC blocks that
reduce heat gain in the interiors. Fenestrations are
arranged to bring in ample daylight in interior spaces.
The stone jaali plays a vital role in minimising glare
and providing diffused light. The design of the jaali

Understanding the emotions of fuel vulnerability
Current policies concerning fuel poverty tend to overlook the emotional and lived experiences. Researchers within our Science, Society and Sustainability Group explored the emotional engagements of energy vulnerability among social housing tenants. The findings revealed how fear and worry can shape patterns of energy use and payment, and how embarrassment and stigma can prevent people seeking support. The research was the first to show that emotions are not merely a consequence of energy vulnerability but can also contribute and shape it. Findings from the research raise fundamental issues for the future governance of the market – highlighting that analysis of fuel poverty would benefit from focusing more on the real-world phenomena which underpin this complex problem.",Social housing tenants are more likely to experience fuel poverty if they are worried or embarrassed about their energy use., 사회 주택 세입자가 에너지 사용에 대해 걱정하거나 당황하면 연료 빈곤을 경험할 가능성이 더 큽니다.,10,3

People with dementia often struggle with navigation and around 40,000 people go missing in the UK every year. Research led by the UEA in collaboration with University College London, the University of Leeds, the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, and Norfolk Constabulary explored whether there was a correlation between people going missing and the outdoor environment they went missing from. Researchers studied 210 ‘missing person’ reports for people with dementia to see whether the design of road networks could play a part. They found that people are more likely to be reported missing in areas where the road structures are complicated and disordered.

This has allowed the Research Group to
provide a key de-risking service to allow for
the development of the tidal energy sector

full-scale blades to help the sector reach
commercial viability; the companies tested
for include Orbital Marine Power (Scotland),
ORPC (USA/Ireland), Schottel (Germany) and
ÉireComposites (Ireland). As a direct result
of these testing campaigns, operational trials
have commenced in Alaska and Scotland. For
example, the ORPC device completed over
7,000,000 revolutions during its ten months
of operation, making it the longest operating
current energy converter in America. This
technology is being further developed in our
ongoing collaborative H2020-CRIMSON

their interaction within the natural and built
environments. Through the programme,
students develop skills to appraise sustainability
issues and challenges associated with
integrating the built and natural environments.
Through the Masters in Rural Future Planning

rural represents a key sphere in any discussion
on sustainable development, while also
recognising that the profile of rural areas is
evolving. While agriculture remains a vital
component of the rural economy, other
sectors (e.g. industry and retail) now provide
the bulk of employment. In this regard, the
rural increasingly mirrors the urban. Therefore,

the Remote Working in Ireland project. Phase 1
of the project analysed findings from a survey of
over 7,000 people, approximately six weeks after
COVID-19 restrictive measures were introduced
in Ireland. The majority (83%) of respondents
indicated that they would like to work remotely
after the crisis is over. The top three advantages
of working remotely were identified as: no
traffic and no commute; reduced costs of going
to work and commuting and; greater flexibility
as to how to manage the working day. Phase
two of the survey gathered responses from
more than 5,000 employees six months after
lockdown and shows that 94% of employees
are in favour of working from home some or
all of the time. The third survey gathered data
