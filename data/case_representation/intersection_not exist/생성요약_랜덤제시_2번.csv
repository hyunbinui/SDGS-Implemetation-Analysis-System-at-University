19,남아프리카 공화국,Pretoria,"Restoration for resilience Two key restoration initiatives undertaken in 2019 through 2020 were the Strubenkop Restoration Project and Hartebeestspruit Restoration Project. The Colbyn Wetlands are also closely associated with the Hartebeestspruit riverine system. The Strubenkop outcrop is located on the University’s Hillcrest campus. Prior to the initiative, it was heavily infested with alien and/or invader weeds, shrubs and trees. Wide areas of this particularly difficult terrain have been cleared of alien and invader species, and rubble. Restoration has been undertaken by introducing and replanting original indigenous plant species, including grass, thereby creating the conditions required for ecological plant succession. Natural vegetation is returning, and animal and bird species are once again populating the area. The Hartebeestspruit is a typical urban riverine system, and subject to annual flooding. The water body flows south to north, along the western boundary of Hillcrest campus. The associated Colbyn Wetlands, which fall beyond the University’s boundary, constitute a sensitive ecosystem with unique flora, and play a role in filtering specific pollutants from waterways running downstream. With the rapidly changing urban environment upstream, the Hartebeestspruit Restoration Project focuses on strengthening resilience of the urban water channel. Activities include stabilisation of the embankment by means of a bio-engineering approach; civil engineering works to reintroduce the flood plains while being mindful of adjacent development, and to redirect water during flood surges; establishing plant filtration areas to filter toxic water from upstream; clearing alien invasive flora, in particular kikuyu grass infestations; and the establishment of indigenous and locally adapted plant species. Recuperation of the area is evident, with the return of bird life, insects, reptiles, and other animals alongside the recovering plant life.

A cross-disciplinary team at UCL has linked the need for
safe sanitation to all 17 SDGs, demonstrating the far-reaching benefits of investing in sanitation infrastructure that go beyond better health. “More than half the world’s population lack access to safely managed sanitation, and in 2017 approximately two billion people were still living without even the most basic sanitation,” explains
Dr Priti Parikh, Director of the
UCL Engineering for International Development Centre. “This increases morbidity rates, healthcare costs and reduces productivity.” To ensure everything possible is done to address this lack of basic human rights, Dr Parikh is drawing attention to the importance of sanitation infrastructure and management by reviewing its impact across all the other SDGs.
The review has identified synergies between sanitation and two
thirds (130) of the 169 Targets
and trade-offs for a third of them, across all 17 SDGs, demonstrating the far-reaching benefits that can be unlocked from investment in sanitation, which extend beyond health.

Computer algorithms built into the sensor then scan the images to identify the presence of different bat species by their calls.
“Bat species are a good indicator of the general health of the natural environment in a particular area,” explains Professor Kate Jones (UCL Centre for Biodiversity & Environment Research), Director of the People and Nature Lab. “They are the top predator of nocturnal insects, so the impact of any changes in land use on the insect species has a knock-on impact

RMIT’s Sustainability Policy provides guidance and direction
to minimise resource consumption through good design,
including actively promoting efficient water use and
maximising its reuse across the University. In 2020, RMIT
consumed a total of 113,073 kilolitres of potable water in
Australian higher education operations, a decrease of 38%
from 2019 (182,426 kilolitres). This decrease was significantly
influenced by the COVID-19 Pandemic and the move to
remote learning.
The total volume of potable water is measured using water
supply authority meters installed across all RMIT sites and
provided to the University through regular invoicing. RMIT has
a total capacity of 1,278 kilolitres in rainwater and stormwater
tanks installed across our campuses, which provide water for
toilet flushing and irrigation purposes. Additionally, RMIT has
a significant stormwater catchment pond at the Bundoora
Campus, providing a further 1,350 kilolitres of storage. RMIT
sustainably extracts water from this pond for irrigation purposes
throughout the campus, further reducing the requirements
for potable water use. These initiatives provide RMIT with an
estimated 12,000 kilolitres of water reuse every year.
RMIT Design Standards provides minimum standards for new
buildings and refurbishments to minimise water use, through
general design principles, water sensitive urban design initiatives,
and specifying minimum water efficiency standards for fixtures

for water purification
Less than one per cent of all the water on earth is fresh water,
and the quality of this water is regularly compromised. Water
pollution is a major global issue as industry, agriculture and
municipalities have and in some cases continue to discharge
waste into water supplies. While this waste can include solids
and minerals that can be filtered or coagulated from the solution,
infectious agents, toxic chemicals and other hazardous materials,
many of them nonbiodegradable organic compounds, threaten
water quality. The Hybrid photocatalytic nanomaterials for water
purification project addresses these issues. This project is funded
by the Australian Research Council (ARC) and a collaboration
between RMIT’s Professor Rachel Caruso, RMIT Enabling
Capability Platform Director, Advanced Materials), Professor
Srinivasan Madapusi, Professor Yasuhiro Tachibana and Dr
Ken Chiang from RMIT’s School of Engineering.
Advanced Oxidation Technologies are effective to degrade these
organic compounds as they decompose the contaminants into
less harmful compounds. Photocatalysis is viewed as the most
advantageous of the Advanced Oxidation Technologies as it has
low operational and installation costs. Using sunlight to initiate
the reactions also makes the process environmentally friendly.
This project focuses on photocatalytic materials for water
purification to address the significant problem. It has also
focused on synthesising and testing novel photocatalytic
nanomaterials to address the intrinsic shortfalls in many current
photocatalytic materials. Potential outcomes will include the
production of industrially relevant photocatalysts and building
capability in Australia to decrease photocatalytic testing time

Ninety-five per cent of litter transported through stormwater
drains into rivers, ultimately ends up on beaches in Port Phillip
Bay. From cigarette butts to plastic bottles, most of what is
dropped on our streets is washed into the stormwater system
by rainfall, travels via our waterways to our bays and washes
onto our beaches.
Our catchments receive stormwater from urban areas.
This stormwater often contains litter carried from Melbourne’s
streets into the drainage system, which is transferred into local
creeks and rivers. Litter items may be trapped in stream-side
vegetation, collected by litter traps, or transported along the
waterway eventually ending up in Port Phillip Bay. Litter reduces
water quality and harms aquatic life through ingestion,
choking and accumulation of pollutants.
As part of the Litter Trackers project, scientists from the RMIT
School of Science are working with schools and community
groups to launch GPS tracked bottles into Melbourne’s

applying circular economy principles to capital projects to
continue avoiding waste and strengthen reuse.
In 2020, RMIT had 18 active capital development projects,
from which 499 tonnes of waste was produced and 90 per cent

Concrete is made using sand, a substance ubiquitous across
the modern world and unrivalled in its strength and reliability as
a building material. However, the global thirst for concrete has
many negative social and environmental impacts due to the
necessity to mine sand.
There are now concerns that the world is running out of the
type of sand that can be used to manufacture concrete and
an alternative more sustainable option is needed. Concrete
comprises cement, water and aggregate, which is usually sand
or gravel depending on the type of concrete needed. However,
the widespread use of alternative aggregates made of recycled
materials has been hindered by the fact they do not perform
as strongly as traditional sand and gravel.
PhD researchers Syed Kazmi and Muhammad Munir, led
by Professor Yufei Wu, have developed a new Rubberized
Concrete Processing Technology (RCP-Tech). The RCPTech
acts as a new method to cast concrete made with
recycled aggregate (generally from industrial waste and recycled
tyres), rather than mined sand. The method involves casting
the concrete using these sustainable aggregates and then
compressing the mixture to its lowest minimum volume in
a pressurised mould. The resulting concrete is 35 per cent
stronger than traditional concrete.
The RCP-Tech Team is now seeking to co-partner with the
precast concrete industry to manufacture prototypes of common
concrete products such as slabs, roadside barriers, beams
and blocks. The team presented their project at the 2020 City
of Melbourne Open Innovation Competition, where they were

valuable complex molecules out of diverse, impure raw materials.
Waste cooking oil currently has to go through an energy-intensive

‘sewage enhanced’ steel slag
Researchers have shown how a by-product of steel making
can be used to both treat wastewater and make stronger
concrete, in a zero-waste approach to help advance the circular
economy. Produced during the separation of molten steel from
impurities, steel slag is often used as a substitute aggregate
material for making concrete. Steel slag can also be used to
absorb contaminants like phosphate, magnesium, iron, calcium,
silica and aluminium in the wastewater treatment process, but
loses its effectiveness over time.
Engineering researchers at RMIT University examined whether
slag that had been used to treat wastewater could then be
recycled as an aggregate material for concrete. The concrete
made with post-treatment steel slag was about 17 per cent
stronger than concrete made with conventional aggregates, and
8 per cent stronger than raw steel slag. Water engineer Dr Biplob
Pramanik said the study was the first to investigate potential
applications for “sewage-enhanced” slag in construction
material.
The global steel making industry produces over 130 million
tonnes of steel slag every year. A lot of this by-product already
goes into concrete, but Pramanik says we’re missing the
opportunity to wring out the full benefits of this material.
While there are technical challenges to overcome, it is hoped
this research moves us one step closer to the ultimate goal
of an integrated, no-waste approach to all our raw materials

rubble to make sustainable roads
RMIT’s new research project has shown how a blend of old
tyres and building rubble could be used as a sustainable
road-making material, in a zero-waste solution to boost
recycling and support the circular economy. Construction,
renovation and demolition account for about half the waste
produced annually worldwide, while around one billion scrap
tyres are generated globally each year. The new material,
developed by researchers at RMIT University, is the first to
combine recycled rubble and rubber in a mix that is precisely
optimised to meet road engineering safety standards.
Designed to be used for base layers, the recycled blend is
more flexible than standard materials, making roads less
prone to cracking. Lead researcher Dr Mohammad Boroujeni
said the rubble-rubber mix could deliver both environmental
and engineering benefits. Traditional road bases are made of
unsustainable virgin materials – quarried rock and natural sand.
However, the new blended material is a 100% recycled
alternative that offers a new way to reuse tyre and building
waste, while performing strongly on key criteria like flexibility,
strength and permanent deformation.
In Australia, only 16% of scrap tyres are domestically recycled.
About 3.15 million tonnes of processed building rubble – known
as recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) – is added to stockpiles
each year rather than being reused. In 2019, federal and
state governments agreed to ban the export of certain waste
materials, to build Australia’s capacity to generate high value
recycled commodities and associated demand. As part of the
agreement, whole used tyres will be banned from export by
December 2021.","Scrap tyres and building rubble could be used as a sustainable road-making material, in a zero-waste solution to boost recycling and support the circular economy.", 스크랩 타이어와 건물 잔해는 재활용을 촉진하고 순환 경제를 지원하는 폐기물 제로 솔루션에서 지속 가능한 도로 건설 재료로 사용될 수 있습니다.,12,2

RMIT is committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030 and is
striving to achieve this target ahead of schedule. The University
is taking urgent action to combat climate change and its
impacts, through the commitment to reducing greenhouse
gas emissions and adapting the University and its systems
to a changing climate.
RMIT achieved a 62 per cent decrease in greenhouse gas
emissions in 2020 from the 2007 emissions baseline, and is
committed to reducing its emission profile by implementing
the RMIT Carbon Management Plan. The plan covers the

Climate change and its impacts are posing a significant risk for
society today. In Australia, extreme conditions such as droughts,
bushfires, cyclones and floods are expected to become more
frequent and more severe. Universities are important public
organisations that have significant elements at risk from climaterelated
impacts; including buildings, infrastructure assets, and
its community. It is therefore important that key climate risks are
identified, and the necessary adaptation options implemented
to increase resilience to future climate shocks and stresses. The
RMIT Climate Change Adaptation Plan is mainstreaming climate
change considerations, developing the data and knowledge
necessary for informed climate adaptation and establishing
coordination mechanisms for the University. The adaptation
plan outlines three significant climate impacts to RMIT University

RMIT provides expert advice to The Victorian Department
of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) regarding
a process to identify cross-sector climate change risks
and vulnerabilities. DELWP suggests that a sector-based
approach is used to develop coordinated and coherent sectoral
policy responses in anticipation of the complex challenges of
adapting to climate change. Sectors must collaborate to address
climate change risks and vulnerabilities, identify trade-offs, and
realise potential opportunities. This presents many governance
challenges, including spanning conventional boundaries and
bringing together policymakers and stakeholders with different
objectives, interests and ways of working.
In this project, RMIT is supporting DELWP and the Adaptation
Action Plans (AAP) leads regarding the identification of and
planning for cross-sector climate change risks and vulnerabilities.
RMIT’s approach used concepts and methods from systems
thinking, adaptive pathways planning, adaptive governance, and
organisational learning theory to produce a background research
report on four topics and core questions defined by DELWP: (1)
sector-based adaptation planning; (2) maladaptation; (3) risk and
vulnerability assessments; and (4) monitoring and evaluation.
A framework to identify sector-based and cross-sector risks
and vulnerabilities was also produced. This framework takes
participants through a collaborative and learning-based process
to understand their system and its interactions. It is intended
for use both within government and in collaboration with
stakeholders.","RMIT is supporting the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) and the Adaptation Action Plans (AAP) leads regarding the identification of and planning for cross-sector climate change risks and vulnerabilities."," RMIT는 빅토리아주 환경, 토지, 수자원 및 계획부(DELWP)와 부문 간 기후 변화 위험 및 취약성의 식별 및 계획과 관련하여 AAP(Adaptation Action Plans) 주도를 지원합니다.",13,2

a critical policy brief entitled Climate Change Adaptation
and Mitigation in Suburban Melbourne.
This policy brief report outlines state-of-the-art climate change
mitigation and adaptation measures for urban development

solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; managing
known climate change risks; developing adaptive capacity by
increasing flexibility and resilience; the systemic interactions
between different disciplinary themes and principles, and
potential governance arrangements that seek to integrate climate
mitigation and adaptation measures into planning practice.
This report states the following agenda items for the Victorian
Government planning system to achieve the step-change
required to address the climate change mitigation and adaptation
challenges in Melbourne’s suburbs: (1) Build the capacity at both
state and local government level to take a more proactive role
in formulating strategic, long-term objectives for a low-carbon,

The Climate Change Exchange Network at RMIT is overseeing
the ‘Local Government Climate Change Adaptation Roles
and Responsibilities under Victorian Legislation: Guidance
for local government decision-makers’ project that informs
local governments on their legal roles and responsibilities
under Victorian legislation for climate change adaptation.
Its purpose is to inform local governments of their legal roles
and responsibilities under Victorian legislation for climate
change adaptation.
A legislative analysis and local government consultation
workshops informed this project, run by Dr Tayanah O’Donnell
and Associate Professors Susie Moloney and Andrew Butt.
It is co-designed with the Victorian Department of Environment,
Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) and local government
representatives including the Municipal Association of Victoria
and the Western and Northern Greenhouse Alliance. The
consultation workshops engaged with 78 council representatives
across three regions in Victoria, representing rural, coastal and

The central aim was to design a guidance brief for council
staff to use in making reasonable decisions while navigating
legal roles and responsibilities with respect to climate change.
To ensure this project would be useful for local governments,
the team adopted a ‘reasonable decisionmaker’ framing, to help
the reader of this report and the accompanying guidance brief,

Melbourne’s rivers, wetlands, and bays are all affected by
a variety of pollutants. Different land uses and activities in
urban and rural areas generate different types of pollution and
it is essential to identify the sources and impacts of high-risk
pollutants to protect ecological, social and amenity values.
RMIT is completing a research project, in partnership with
Melbourne Water, to produce a synopsis of current literature,
of the sources and impacts of pollutants on waterways and
bays from urban and rural landscapes in the Melbourne region.
Expected outcomes of this project include: (1) provide a
synthesis of the sources and impacts of urban and rural pollution
that are likely to pose a significant risk to environmental values;
(2) identify priority sources and pollutants of concern in urban
and rural waterways; (3) recommend options (management and
research) to reduce the risk of urban and rural pollutants on the
receiving waterways; (4) increase confidence in management
interventions linked to identified factors to reduce pollutants to
streams, wetlands, estuaries and bays; (5) influence stormwater
management policy, rural land management policy and planning;

Successfully meeting Sustainable Development Goals 14 and

biodiversity–hinges on influencing human behaviours that impact
biodiversity. Selecting which behaviours to change and the most
effective interventions to change them can be challenging, as
the behaviours that influence biodiversity outcomes are rarely
directly linked to biodiversity. RMIT collaborated with the
DELWP to prioritise conservation behaviours by 1) identifying
key behaviours in Australia that positively or negatively influence
biodiversity, 2) examining the best interventions to change them,
and 3) estimating the projected benefits and cost-effectiveness
to biodiversity if these behaviours were changed.
As a first step in the prioritisation process, an expert elicitation
workshop was held that identified 27 key conservation
behaviours that any Victorian could undertake. Experts were
asked to rate those behaviours based on the behaviour’s
impact on biodiversity and the potential likelihood of a behaviour
change. One of the prioritised behaviours was examined by
behaviour change experts, specifically beef consumption,
to provide suggestions of what interventions would be most
effective in reducing beef consumption providing advantages
and disadvantages. Finally, case studies of Victorian-based
pet cat containment and wildlife gardening behaviour change
programs were assessed for the direct and indirect impacts
the interventions may have on biodiversity and compared the
cost-effectiveness of different intervention scenarios. This project
not only advanced behavioural prioritisation methods but also
informed DELWP policy encouraging everyday Victorians to
act for biodiversity.","RMIT and the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) have worked together to advance behavioural prioritisation methods to influence human behaviours that impact biodiversity.", RMIT와 DELWP(환경 토지 수자원 계획부)는 생물 다양성에 영향을 미치는 인간 행동에 영향을 미치는 행동 우선 순위 지정 방법을 발전시키기 위해 협력했습니다.,14,2

New RMIT research has shown that the water-absorbing
green floral foam used by florists is contributing to the world’s
microplastic problem. A study published in Science of the
Total Environment, by academics of RMIT’s School of Science,
found the plastic foam, which breaks into tiny pieces, can be
ingested by a range of freshwater and marine animals and
affect their health.
The vast majority of florists who use foam are disposing of
floral foam particles down the sink, according to a recent survey
by the Sustainable Floristry Network. The survey of more than
1200 florists globally found two-thirds of florists use foam, and of
those that do, 72 per cent pour the foam wastewater down the
sink or drain, while 15 per cent add it to the garden or soil.
A social media trend of crushing floral foam, often directly into
the sink, is also adding to floral foam pollution issues, with one
video promoting the fad amassing 70 million views. Each foam
block is equivalent in weight to around ten plastic bags. Floral
foam has been the base medium of choice for florists all over
the world since its invention in the 1950s.
The RMIT study showed that floral foam microplastics also
leach chemicals into the surrounding water and these were more
toxic to aquatic invertebrates than leachates from other plastic
families. This study points out that more research is needed to
better understand the impact of ingestion of the particles and
related compounds on animals.","A study published in Science of the Total Environment, by academics of RMIT’s School of Science, found the plastic foam, which breaks into tiny pieces, can be ingested by a range of freshwater and marine animals and affect their health.",RMIT 과학 대학 학자들이 총 환경 과학(Science of the Total Environment)에 발표한 연구에 따르면 작은 조각으로 부서지는 플라스틱 폼이 다양한 담수 및 해양 동물에 의해 섭취되어 건강에 영향을 미칠 수 있음을 발견했습니다.,14,2

tuna farmers to make informed decisions about managing the
health of their stock.
The first findings of this partnership, published in the Journal of

of ranched tuna and a reduction in parasite numbers. Though
naturally occurring in approximately five per cent of wild tuna,
the parasites are of particular concern for fishers who capture
and keep fish alive for ranching in areas where the polychaete
is more common.
RMIT lead researcher Dr Nathan Bott found the new methods
were needed to enable accurate samples to be taken without
harming live fish, as the current diagnostic testing methodology
is fatal and involves taking samples from the tuna’s gills, blood
and internal organs. Improved diagnostic testing would help
to provide more accurate guidelines for when to treat affected
fish, reducing the cost of treatment and lowering mortality.",Researchers at RMIT in Melbourne are working with the Australian bluefin tuna industry to improve the health of fish caught for ranching., 멜버른 RMIT의 연구원들은 호주 참다랑어 업계와 협력하여 목장에서 잡은 물고기의 건강을 개선하고 있습니다.,14,2

Globally, coffee is grown by more than 25 million farmers
across 60 countries and is a highly traded global commodity,
with approx. 9.66 billion kg consumed annually. Coffee is
grown in some of the most biodiverse areas of the world and
while coffee benefits from increased biodiversity, its production
is also a driver of biodiversity loss. Biodiverse shade-grown
coffee, as opposed to sun-grown coffee, is intended to be
better for biodiversity (e.g. through primary forest restrictions;
canopy habitat protection; proper disposal of waste products).
Mainstreaming shade-grown coffee is key for the industry to
mitigate risk from climate change and environmental degradation.
In an ongoing research project funded by the Australian
Research Council, Zoos Victoria and Melbourne-based
Genovese Coffee, members of the Interdisciplinary Conservation
Science Research (ICON Science) group at RMIT are examining
the structural and behavioural barriers to increased biodiversityfriendly

for Growing Populations
In September 2020, RMIT’s ICON Science Group made
a submission to the Victorian Parliamentary Inquiry into
‘Environmental Infrastructure for Growing Populations.’ This
inquiry was designed to investigate whether the provision of
green spaces and infrastructure has caught up with Melbourne’s
rapid growth.
The submission discussed RMIT research which showed
that Melbourne has lost 2,000 hectares of tree cover between
2014-2018, and how many Melburnians do not have access to
a green space within walking distance of their house. The group
then prepared a map that compared socio-economic status with
access to environmental infrastructure (such as green spaces
and tree canopy) throughout Melbourne, which highlighted a
trend of economic disadvantage being correlated to lack of
proximity to nature. This furthers social disadvantage, as green
spaces provide a swathe of mental and physical health benefits.
The team also stressed the importance of labelling tree canopy
as ‘green infrastructure’ given the role it plays in mitigating the
Urban Heat Island Effect and providing habitat for urban bird and
wildlife populations.
The group advised that green infrastructure development needed
to be ramped up to increase urban biodiversity to benefit both
the natural environment and humans. The Group also reiterated
that although Melbourne has good biodiversity planning on
paper, actual policy implementation needs to follow, especially
in the wake of the urban transformation which accompanied
COVID-19. The team concluded that urban biodiversity helps

The ICON Science Research Group at RMIT began investigating
how invertebrate species use green roofs in Melbourne,
as part of their focus on urban biodiversity and human-nature
interactions. Species in Melbourne include butterflies, bees,
spiders and snails, which are important for pollination, ecosystem
structure, and cultural heritage. Green roofs are increasing in
Melbourne, as they allow for infill green infrastructure without
taking land away from building capital. They also provide benefits
such as thermal buffering and stormwater retention. However,
despite the increasing prevalence of green roofs, their impacts
as habitats for birds and animals are still largely unknown.
The study by Dr Georgia Garrard and PhD candidate Katherine
Berthon, with Research Assistant Jessica Baum, monitored
two retrofit green roofs (in Fitzroy and the Docklands) to examine
how they are used by local invertebrate species. Identifying the
species are living there, and if they can adapt to the unique
conditions of a green roof.
Furthermore, the study examined which animals ‘move in’
first to the green roofs, as well as the different transport
mechanisms species use to get there. Examining plant-insect
interactions to better understand why insects prefer groundbased
green spaces to green roofs. Data from the study will

developing an alternative to the pervasive, yet unsuccessful,
biodiversity offsetting approach.
A key outcome of the project will be a new framework for
biodiversity onsetting, tested against environmental and social

novel habitats. The project will deliver tangible environmental
benefits with a substantial legacy. The shift away from off-site,
future biodiversity gains and towards on-site gains will assist
Australia’s ability to meet international obligations, by slowing
the decline of biodiversity associated with urban development
and agriculture and providing new opportunities for habitats

The research project, ‘Bio-acoustic Monitoring of Frogs’ was
carried out by PhD candidate Brendan Casey and supervised
by Dr Jeff Hughes and Associate Professor Jeff Shimeta.
The project trialled bio-acoustic monitoring of frog populations
in situ within habitats located around the fringes of suburban
Melbourne. Several potential sites were identified and the
monitoring continued over several seasons. Bio-acoustic
monitoring involved placing recorders in the field capable
of monitoring frog calls.
The project focused on the Growling Grass Frog, an endangered
frog species which is threatened by both loss of habitat (mainly
loss of wetlands to development) and attack by the chytrid
fungus. The project included all frog species that may potentially
be found at the trial sites. The bio-acoustic monitoring ran
concurrently with standard monitoring (desktop surveys and site
visits) so the two techniques could be compared. To achieve this
a reference library of frog calls was designed. The project aimed
to develop a reliable, non-invasive technique for determining the
presence and diversity of frog species.
To further test the value of bioacoustics monitoring for studying
rare and endangered species, the method was also used to try
and record the Giant Burrowing Frog in East Gippsland. This
frog is extremely rare in Victoria and there are only a few reliable
reported detections of this frog in the past 20 years. Recorders
were placed in the field in the Mitchell River Catchment and
measurements taken over three years. Success came when
this frog was recorded only an hour before the project was due

Pakistan
A Charles Sturt research team, led by Dr Michael
Mitchell, is investigating adaptation options and
strategies with people managing and living in
salinity-affected agricultural landscapes in Pakistan.
Australia and Pakistan share the challenges
of developing agriculture within water scarce,
salinity-affected landscapes. As with the
Murray-Darling Basin, salinity in Pakistan’s Indus
Basin naturally has some salinity challenges but has
also been significantly impacted by human-induced
changes driven primarily by irrigation. It is estimated
that 15 million tonnes of salt are added annually to
the Indus Basin. Salinity affects at least 4.5 million
hectares across the country, and 54 per cent of the
lower part of the Indus Basin. Increased dependence
on poor quality groundwater, due to limited and
unreliable surface water supplies, is accelerating the
extent and severity of land salinisation.
The expected project outcomes include:
• development of a readily available
knowledge bank about salinity for
the staff of Pakistan-based projects,
programs, and organisations relevant to
agricultural development
• improved understanding of the opportunities for,
and constraints to, current options for adapting
to salinity
• individuals and groups (including women
and youth) from the project’s case study
communities are building capacity to plan their
futures for adapting well to salinity
• relevant government departments, policymakers,

• minimise the use of energy and water;
• reduce the purchasing of material goods and
hazardous chemicals; and
• cut down waste production.
In 2020, the Green Labs Program achievements
include:
• visiting 35 labs
• engaging approximately 50 staff
• more than 18,000 square metres of lab floor

Staff from Baranduda Primary School celebrate the delivery of
their reclaimed board table.
Charles Sturt has maintained a long-standing
requirement for building contractors to record
and report their waste and recycling efforts. We

repurpose it wherever possible.
In previous years, surplus furniture was stored in
shipping containers where it slowly deteriorated,
ending up in landfill. We now divert office furniture
from landfill that is surplus to our requirements
and still in good condition. When we implement a
refurbishment project now, we decide how to reuse
and recycle each piece of furniture immediately. We
no longer waste money, time, and space on storage.
Decisions are made with contractors immediately
as to which furniture is in the best condition to be
offered to external community groups.

refurbishments where 100 per cent of the furniture
items, including 42 desks, over 40 office chairs,

A research project led by Professor Kevin Parton

various policy approaches to stabilising agricultural

farm management deposits, seasonal climate
forecasts and new technology.
It is important to examine policies for stabilising
agriculture, given the current climate challenges
facing the sector. Such changes in climate since
2000 have reduced average annual broadacre farm
profits in Australia. Higher temperatures and lower
rainfall have driven a stagnation in productivity. For
wheat, potential yield declined by 1.2 tonnes per
hectare, while actual yield has remained steady,
indicating that farmers had narrowed the ‘yield
gap’, the distance between actual and potential
yield. Wheat simulation modelling showed that
median wheat yields at various locations were
much affected by future climates. For example,
wheat yields in the south-west agricultural regions
of Western Australia were projected to decline by
between 26 per cent and 38 per cent by 2090,

diverts more than 37 tonnes of organic
waste
The Albury-Wodonga campus has spared more
than 37 tonnes of kitchen, bathroom, and garden
waste from potentially ending up in landfill over
the last 12 months due to the efforts of outdoor
facilities and cleaning staff who implemented a food
and garden organics collection system.
Every kilogram of organic waste in landfill
emits nearly two kilograms of greenhouse gas,
which means the waste service at the campus
has prevented a significant volume of carbon
emissions from being emitted. In recognition of
this, the Charles Sturt Campus Services team
in Albury-Wodonga received a ‘Sustainability
Champion’ award.
Other Charles Sturt campuses are now
introducing organic waste systems based on the
Albury-Wodonga example with the Wagga Wagga
campus bringing in commercial collections in its
catering area in January 2021, and the Bathurst
campus set to start onsite composting trials later
this year.",Charles Sturt University’s Albury-Wodonga campus has become the first campus in Australia to divert all its organic waste from landfill., Charles Sturt University의 Albury-Wodonga 캠퍼스는 매립지에서 모든 유기 폐기물을 전용한 호주 최초의 캠퍼스가 되었습니다.,15,2

inspires research and teaching
In the aftermath of the catastrophic bushfires earlier
this year, Graham Centre member and Charles Sturt
academic Dr Joanne Connolly answered a call from
the NSW Wildlife Council to assist in the emergency
response for native fauna.
As a veterinarian with wildlife experience and a
tranquilliser dart gun licence, she volunteered at the
Wildlife Rescue South Coast wildlife centre along
with local wildlife carers, veterinarians from Australia
and North America and emergency response teams
from New Zealand (HUHA).
Dr Connolly said this involved animal rescues,
rearing orphans, sedation and anaesthesia, treating
burnt or injured wildlife, and cases involving
cardio-respiratory disease, blood parasites, seizures,
and myopathy.
“I was able to assist with some innovative burn
and pain management techniques used by visiting
experts from the University of California, Davis. It
was very rewarding to be a part of the rescue and
treatment effort,” Dr Connolly said.
The experience has inspired Dr Connolly to pursue
her research interest in emergency bushfire
wildlife rehabilitation.
She is also leading the development of a new
subject at Charles Sturt to build capacity within
Australia in the field of wildlife rescue, health
assessment, minimising stress and pain and
supportive management aimed at successful animal
release and integration into wild populations.",All images are copyrighted., 모든 이미지는 저작권이 있습니다.,15,2

361,캐나다,British Columbia,"Climate Movement When it comes to climate change action, UBC stands out. In 2010, UBC committed to bold greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets that were, and continue to be, among the most aggressive of the world’s top 40 universities. Using 2007 as a baseline, the UBC Vancouver campus committed to 33% GHG reduction by 2015, 67% reduction by 2020, and 100% reduction by 2050. Both campuses have been carbon neutral through offsets since 2010. In 2016, UBC Okanagan released their Whole Systems Infrastructure Plan. The Plan proposed actions to guide the next phase of the physical planning and design of campus across multiple performance areas, including energy, carbon, water, rainwater, ecology and biodiversity. In 2018, the UBC Board of Governors (BoG) adopted a Green Building Action Plan designed to advance campus buildings on both campuses towards net positive contributions in human and ecological health. In December 2019, the UBC BoG unanimously endorsed a Declaration on the Climate Emergency. The declaration includes a commitment to accelerate emissions reductions aligned with the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It also Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts includes a commitment to widen the scope of UBC’s climate action planning to include areas that extend beyond UBC operations, but over which UBC has control or influence, such as commuting, air travel and food services. In addition, the BoG recommended transfer of the entire $381 million in the Trek Endowment Pool over to the Sustainable Futures Pool, which invests in low-carbon, fossil-fuel free funds. In 2020, President Ono established a Climate Emergency Task Force comprised of students, faculty and staff to gather ideas from the UBC community and propose recommendations to address the climate emergency. A new Climate Action Plan (CAP 2030) is due for release in 2021 and will define new emissions reduction actions and identify accelerated targets along with implementation strategies for the next 10 years.

However, no air temperature data is available for the Campbelltown City Council area as official weather stations can only be found outside the local government area. The heat sensor project allows us to gauge detailed information into the micro climate of the region.” Dr Sebastian Pfautsch, Environment and Sustainability Research Theme Fellow Researchers launched a heat sensor project to measure the air temperature in 110 locations across Campbelltown LGA. The project uncovered a significant warming trend from forested to urbanised locations. On average, landscapes that were dominated by grey infrastructure were 1.5°C warmer compared to landscapes where grey infrastructure was absent. Although landscapes dominated by hard surfaces heated up slower during the morning, they cooled down less during the night, leading to heat island effects.

In 2010, UBC committed to bold greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets that were, and continue to be, among the most aggressive of the world’s top 40 universities. Using 2007 as a baseline, the UBC Vancouver campus committed to 33% GHG reduction by 2015, 67% reduction by 2020, and 100% reduction by 2050. Both campuses have been carbon neutral through offsets since 2010. In 2016, UBC Okanagan released their Whole Systems Infrastructure Plan. The Plan proposed actions to guide the next phase of the physical planning and design of campus across multiple performance areas, including energy, carbon, water, rainwater, ecology and biodiversity. In 2018, the UBC Board of Governors (BoG) adopted a Green Building Action Plan designed to advance campus buildings on both campuses towards net positive contributions in human and ecological health. In December 2019, the UBC BoG unanimously endorsed a Declaration on the Climate Emergency. The declaration includes a commitment to accelerate emissions reductions aligned with the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It also Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts includes a commitment to widen the scope of UBC’s climate action planning to include areas that extend beyond UBC operations, but over which UBC has control or influence, such as commuting, air travel and food services. In addition, the BoG recommended transfer of the entire $381 million in the Trek Endowment Pool over to the Sustainable Futures Pool, which invests in low-carbon, fossil-fuel free funds. In 2020, President Ono established a Climate Emergency Task Force comprised of students, faculty and staff to gather ideas from the UBC community and propose recommendations to address the climate emergency. A new Climate Action Plan (CAP 2030) is due for release in 2021 and will define new emissions reduction actions and identify accelerated targets along with implementation strategies for the next 10 years.

767,미국,California,"With the adoption of UC’s revised Sustainable Procurement Policy in August 2018, UCOP’s and campuses’ Procurement Services have been ramping up their implementation of the new policy requirements, including those for green spend, economically and socially responsible spend, and inclusion of 15 percent sustainability criteria in all requests for proposals, typically opportunities worth over $100,000 in business annually. In keeping with these new requirements, UC began collecting and reporting data on green spend for the first time. (Green spend is defined as “spend on products meeting the UC ‘preferred level’ of environmental sustainability criteria as laid out in the UC Sustainable Procurement Guidelines.”) Systemwide, UC is meeting green spend goals as a total percentage of spend per product category for cleaning supplies, electronics and indoor office furniture. However, individual UC locations are still currently purchasing products that do not meet minimum sustainability policy requirements in these categories. In the future, UC hopes to report data on water appliances and fixtures, as well as compostable food service ware. Because of data limitations, the following campus pages have data only for cleaning supplies reported this year. In the future, UC hopes to report more product category data for campuses. Many campus and systemwide bids in the past year incorporated robust sustainability requirements, questions and criteria into their solicitations ahead of July 1, 2019, when that piece of the policy officially took effect. Notably, questions pertaining to economic, social or environmental sustainability made up at least 15 percent of the total evaluation in systemwide bids for elevator maintenance services, office furniture, flooring and janitorial services. Additionally, as a result of the minimum required green criteria established for furniture in the Sustainable Procurement Guidelines, the University of California will be the first public university system in the country to adopt the health protective standards promoted by the Center for Environmental
Health (CEH) that restrict the use of key toxic chemicals in indoor furniture. UC’s new furniture contract will leverage its roughly $70 million in purchasing power to protect the over 400,000 students, faculty and staff, plus thousands of visitors and vendors who visit campuses annually, and will push the market toward providing safer and healthier furniture products for consumers and the general public. The systemwide flooring bid similarly included the strictest criteria of any previous flooring bid with respect to chemicals of concern, third-party environmental certifications, recycled content levels and recyclability. Procurement Services continues to monitor and track improvement of its supply base using a third-party sustainability assessment tool, EcoVadis, with several systemwide bids during the last year requiring suppliers to undergo an evaluation as a requirement of award. To date, UC has received scorecards for 79 suppliers that have gone through the assessment process.

Australia and Pakistan share the challenges
of developing agriculture within water scarce,

Murray-Darling Basin, salinity in Pakistan’s Indus
Basin naturally has some salinity challenges but has
also been significantly impacted by human-induced
changes driven primarily by irrigation. It is estimated
that 15 million tonnes of salt are added annually to
the Indus Basin. Salinity affects at least 4.5 million
hectares across the country, and 54 per cent of the
lower part of the Indus Basin. Increased dependence
on poor quality groundwater, due to limited and
unreliable surface water supplies, is accelerating the
extent and severity of land salinisation.

• development of a readily available
knowledge bank about salinity for
the staff of Pakistan-based projects,
programs, and organisations relevant to
agricultural development
• improved understanding of the opportunities for,
and constraints to, current options for adapting

2018 and early 2019, Erasmus MC had contact with the Water Board and the municipality of Rotterdam
about the possible reuse of the clean water in waterways or underground storage facilities in times of
drought. The quality parameters of the clean discharged water were also discussed. Research into reuse
is also a requirement of the WABO (General Provisions for Environmental Law Act) permit. To date,

introduced in several places throughout Erasmus MC. There is
hospital-wide interaction between the Executive Board, the ‘A

preventing the discharge of contrast agents. This is a major step
towards achieving the Green Deal on Sustainable Healthcare 2.0.
It is estimated that around 30,000 liters of CT contrast agents are
discharged into surface water via the sewer system every year.
The contrast agent accumulates in surface water because it is not
biodegradable.
At the radiology department of Erasmus MC and five other
hospitals in the Netherlands, outpatients are provided with urine
bags to take home after their CT scan with contrast agents so
that they can collect their urine at home the first three times they
need to urinate. This is because the contrast agent administered
during the examination will be excreted within 24 hours of the
examination. The urine bag prevents the contrast agent from
entering the environment. These bags have been extensively tested
and are easy for both men and women to use. The urine bag can
be disposed of with the household garbage after use.",The Radiology Green Team has started to take sustainable steps in preventing the discharge of contrast agents., Radiology Green Team은 조영제 배출을 방지하기 위한 지속 가능한 조치를 취하기 시작했습니다.,12,2
885,네덜란드,Erasmus MC," In addition, patients are requested to pass urine once before
leaving the hospital. The Pharmafilter, unlike the regular sewage
plants, can filter out the contrast agent.
The ultimate goal of this pilot is to implement the urine bags
nationwide. This would be a major sustainable step towards
reducing the amount of contrast agent in surface water.
In addition to this project, radiology is also collecting contrast
agent that is left over after a procedure. Previously, this unused
contrast agent ended up in the hospital waste, but this has now
changed. At the end of the working day, the leftover contrast agent
is poured into a special container. These containers are collected
by the manufacturer to be recycled into new contrast agent. The
containers can now be found in all CT rooms, in the interventional
radiology rooms, and radiotherapy has recently joined this
initiative.","For the first time in Germany, urine bags have been installed in the interventional radiology rooms to collect contrast agent that is left over after a procedure.", 독일에서는 처음으로 중재방사선실에 소변주머니를 설치하여 시술 후 남은 조영제를 수집하고 있습니다.,12,2

European Guarantees of Origin do not count in the method used to determine our carbon footprint.
In principle, the goal for the coming years is to generate or purchase entirely green electricity. On
paper it is possible to use Dutch Guarantees of Origin for greening the method used. In practice, fossil
electricity, possibly with Carbon Capture Storage, will remain part of the Dutch electricity mix for
decades to come. At times when the supply of renewable electricity is insufficient, there will always be

be noted that national figures have been used for commuting. These figures will be determined more
accurately in 2021, which means that, as a result of our forward-looking sustainable transport policy,
a downward correction will be made to these findings. In addition, the emission volumes of both

effect on emissions).
Further research in the field of e-Health will certainly be conducted in 2021, but a target of 10% more
digital consultations than before the COVID-19 pandemic period should definitely be possible in the
future. In fourth place is the consumption of natural gas and other fuels (for example, for maintenance

A number of examples are explained below whereby considerable steps were taken in the area of
building management in particular (most new construction projects were postponed in 2020). The use

 Purchase of Nordic freezers: On 01-01-2020 we had 486 freezers at Erasmus MC. One year later this
had been reduced to 425.
 LED lighting was installed at various locations in the building to replace existing lighting. This
replacement program will continue in the coming years.
 Replacing heat exchangers (heat exchangers - district heating connections): A necessary
replacement of the heat exchangers at Erasmus MC was carried out in 2020. This replacement
provided an opportunity to not only modify but also optimize the installation, thus resulting in
energy savings. It is expected that savings of € 185,000 per year will be possible.
 Solar panels on the roofs of Erasmus MC: PIB carried out a study on the possibility of installing solar
panels on the roofs of the buildings. The solar energ",PIB has been able to significantly reduce energy consumption in its buildings., PIB는 건물의 에너지 소비를 크게 줄일 수 있었습니다.,13,2
892,네덜란드,Erasmus MC,"Primary energy consumption in 2020 amounted to 1051 TJ, a decrease of 1.5% compared to 2019.
Primary energy consumption is composed of three components: electricity, gas, and district heating.

district heating by 2.9% and 7.0% respectively. Trends and graphic representations of the consumption
of different energy carriers can be found in Appendix A1.
The COVID-19 pandemic also affected energy consumption in the year under review. On the one hand,
less energy was used during office hours due to remote working, and on the other hand, temporary
use was made of buildings that were vacant. In the hospital, energy-saving measures had a clear
effect. In the medical faculty, there was a reduction in energy consumption due to the vacancy of
Buildings Ec and Fd. Energy consumption in Sophia Children’s Hospital increased slightly. Completion
of the renovated multi-functional Building Ca (11,322 m2) and the increased use of the Buildings Ad, Bd,
and Ba caused an increase in energy consumption. Total square meters of buildings remained the same
at 466,427 m2

An important project is improving the use of the heat pump; the supply area will be increased by
making a connecting pipeline for heating between Building Ee and Eg. This project was started in 2020
and will be completed in 2021. It will result in savings in the use of district heating. Major maintenance
work was carried out in the summer on the steam boilers in Building Ee. The steam boilers are now
equipped with new control technology and several pumps are now speed controlled. The monitoring of
the boiler house process has also been improved. The steam boilers are the largest energy consumers
in the hospital and provide humidification.
In May 2019, special software that will allow office spaces to be used as efficiently as possible was
put into service. The insight gained from this software will lead to a reduction in the number of office
workstations. The implementation of the software means that the demolition of Building Z can start

Energy management is entering a new phase; 2020 was the last year that Erasmus MC had to conform
to the Multi-Year Agreements (MJA3 in Dutch) with the government for saving energy. The objective,
included in the covenant for an energy saving of 8.5% compared to 2015 for the period 2017 to 2020,
appears to have been met. The final assessment will take place later this year. The termination of the
long-term agreements means that Erasmus MC is now subject to the EED (European Energy Efficiency
Directive). The directive requires organizations to carry out and submit an energy audit. We submitted
our audit to DCMR Rijnmond Environmental Service at the end of 2020. The audit was carried out on
the basis of the approved list of measures for healthcare and social welfare institutions. The results
are now being evaluated. The audit must be conducted once every four years. Another part of energy
management involves participation in the Green Deal on Sustainable Healthcare 2.0. To this end, a
roadmap was drawn up with benchmarks in 2030 and 2050. A separate item for making Erasmus MC
buildings more sustainable was included in the long-term investment plan for the first time at the end
20
of 2020. The main focus will be on further energy savings and the
reduction of carbon emissions by Erasmus MC itself. In the coming
years, we will pay particular attention to phasing out steam
humidification generated using natural gas.",The Erasmus MC office in Rijnmond has seen a reduction in the number of staff working from home., Rijnmond의 Erasmus MC 사무실은 재택 근무 직원 수가 감소했습니다.,13,2
895,네덜란드,Erasmus MC,"Due to the increasing internationalization of research, education,

business trips every year. A sizeable number of these are made
by plane. Most of the business trips take place within Europe.
The carbon emissions from air travel are 7 to 11 times higher than
emissions from travel by train. Several
departments have already taken the initiative by opting for video
conferences, not flying to easily accessible cities, compensating for
carbon emissions, and introducing an extra check on the value of a
distant conference.
A sustainable travel policy has now incorporated these measures.
A ‘Train Zone Map’ is a convenient tool for making decisions. The
map provides employees and students with an overview of the
differences between traveling by airplane and public transport
(principally the train) in terms of carbon emissions, travel time,
and ease of travel. The information has led several departments to
make a more conscious choice for the more sustainable solution.
Before the introduction of this Map, a competition was run for the
department with the most sustainable business trips. However,

water conservation issues, not

conservation measures through
identifying appropriate water tariffs

necessary. Lastly, conservation

reduce the amount of nutrients added to the soil and that’s a really good option for mitigating climate

【Abstract】
As the number of natural disasters such as fl oods and landslides increases with the
progress of climate change, it is becoming more and more important to develop
infrastructure for disaster prevention and mitigation. Against this backdrop, green
infrastructure, which utilize the functions of nature to cope with such disasters, has
been attracting attention. Green infrastructure not only has a smaller impact on
ecosystems and landscapes than artifi cial infrastructure (gray infrastructure) such
as dams, but is often less expensive to build and to maintain in the future. I study
the cost-effectiveness of the so-called “ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction:
Eco-DRR” that utilizes green infrastructure from an economic perspectiv e.
【Future prospects】
My research focuses on flood control using forests and retarding basin against
river fl ooding caused by heavy rainfall due to climate change. I plan to expand my
research to include green infrastructure against a wider range of natural disasters.

The University of Texas at Dallas continued the expansion of the campus from 2007 to 2019 by adding the Natural Science and Engineering Research Laboratory, the Center for Brain Health (near the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), the Bioengineering and Sciences Building, the Engineering & Computer Science West Building, a new Science Building, The Davidson-Gundy Alumni Center, and Northside Phase 1 & 2. The addition of these buildings added a floor area of 4,271,121.65 Gross Square Feet. To measure water usage, the baseline year was selected to capture data from before the building growth on campus and associated efficiency with modern buildings. The percentage reduction in potable water usage per weighted campus user was 13.78%, and per unit of floor a reduction by 34.93%. Because of higher efficiency fixtures throughout and the growing student population, per capita usage of water is decreasing.

UT Dallas recovers water at the LEED Platinum Student Services Building and LEED Gold Bioengineering and Sciences Building. The Student Services Building captures rainwater for irrigation use and Bioengineering and Sciences Building features an innovative system that captures rainwater, reverse osmosis reject water harvesting, and condensate capture and utilizes the water to reduce need for potable water in irrigation. UT Dallas has adopted constructions standards that require efficient fixtures in all capital projects and remodels. UT Dallas has also updated irrigation controllers in order only irrigate when plant water needs require that rainfall is supplemented, and to eliminate unnecessary irrigation.

UT Dallas is located within the boundaries of the City of Richardson’s “urbanized area” (UA) and is regulated under the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Phase II Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit. The overall goal of the MS4 permit is to improve the water quality of Cottonwood Creek flowing through our campus into receiving waters, and to protect the US waterways from pollution. Environmental Affairs manages the University’s storm water compliance programs, including permitting, spill prevention, above-ground storage inspections, and outfall inspections. The Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and Stormwater Management Plan is comprised of site maps, BMP details, inspection reports, spill reports, corrective action logs and associated waivers. Contractors who are involved with construction projects on campus must comply with all applicable regulations regarding stormwater protection. Because the EPA and The Clean Water Act required a program for addressing the pollution caused by stormwater discharges, The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality implemented and managed the Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (TPDES) Permitting Program to fulfill all Clean Water Act and federal mandates. By practicing health pollution prevention habits, campus community members can keep pollutants like dirt and common garbage that collect on paved areas from washing into storm drains.

Composting is an important part of the campus waste management program that is continuously evolving. Pre-Consumer food waste contributions began in 2011 in partnership with Dining Services and Facilities Management. In August 2017, a partnership with Organix Recycling formed and enhanced the overall composting program at UT Dallas. With the transition, specialized compost containers were installed near kitchen locations, therefore simplifying the pre-consumer food waste collection process. With this new partnership, additional food items became acceptable in the waste stream that were not previously accepted (for example, meat and dairy products), increasing the amount of food waste that is recycled. As of current, Dining Services has taken the lead and moved to all food waste collections in Dining Hall West.

The UTD Marketing Club partnered with the Office of Sustainability and Dining Services to create educational signage placed in the dining hall to educate students about food waste and how to participate in the composting program.

The University of Texas at Dallas has evolved its composting program from previously targeting only landscape waste, to including pre- and post-consumer food waste, and now to providing students, staff, and faculty the opportunity to compost on-campus. Since 2012, UT Dallas has composted over 420,700 lbs. of food waste, therefore diverting 81 metric tons of CO2 from the atmosphere campus wide. Since expanding the compost program into Housing in September 2018, over 2,950 lbs. of food waste have been composted from on-campus resident participants.

Composting has been on the mind of students for many years. In fall 2018, the UT Dallas Student Government Green Initiative Committee took the lead and collaborated with The Office of Sustainability within Facilities Management, Housing, and Organix Recycling to make the composting program accessible to residents of University Village and Canyon Creek Apartments. In order to participate in the program, residents must attend a compost training. At the training, residents will learn what goes in the compost containers, how to manage individualized food collection caddies, and acquire a combination for the lock securing the containers.

A campus-wide Pollution Prevention Plan is in place that covers several initiatives for source reduction and waste minimization (SRR/WM) on campus, including:

Tracking waste generated and disposal costs by source to help focus waste minimization activities. The majority of these waste types are generated by laboratories, therefore; a large effort is made to work closely with them. This includes a training system for labs encouraging these SW/WM activities, some of which are detailed below.
Campus-wide recycling efforts, including for facilities buildings and campus apartments. This includes the ongoing project of switching from fluorescent lamps to LED to reduce toxicity of waste and frequency of replacement.
All laboratory chemical orders must be reviewed by UT Dallas’ Chemical Safety team through UT Dallas’ procurement system. This has caught mistakes in ordering (ex. 200 liters ordered versus the intended 20 liters), resulting in less unused chemicals and safer storage conditions on campus. It also alerts the hazardous waste team of any new potential wastes to be generated on campus.
UT Dallas also utilizes a Chemical Inventory System (CIS), which inventories and tracks all hazardous chemicals in laboratories. This allows lab members to easily find chemicals that are needed and share chemicals, if needed in small amounts, reducing the chemicals coming onto campus.
UT Dallas also has a program to track certain chemicals of concern, which degrade with age. Quarterly, a report containing “expiring” chemicals is managed by the Chemical Safety team and communicated to the relevant labs. This program encourages the chemicals to be used before expiration or increased hazard, reducing the waste generated.

At UT Dallas, the collected landscape waste materials are integrated into the campus composting operations. Small and medium sized tree limbs are placed in a brush pile where they are eventually shredded down and reused on-campus. Leaves are collected on-campus in heavy duty, reusable bags. The leaves are collected on-campus and added with pre-consumer food waste to make compost, then mixed with soil and reused on campus. UT Dallas also harvests milkweed seeds from our Monarch Waystation to replenish the station. This reduces the demand for milkweed seed purchases from external parties which is protective of campus resources.

In the reporting year for our 2019 AASHE report, the only capital project under construction was the new Science Building. In this project, an estimated 78.23% of construction and demolition materials were diverted from the landfill.","At the University of Texas at Dallas, landscape waste materials are integrated into the campus composting operations.", University of Texas at Dallas에서는 조경 폐기물이 캠퍼스 퇴비화 작업에 통합됩니다.,12,2

UT Dallas is a campus that is comprised of buildings, greenspace, and natural landscaping features that includes many diverse species of flora and fauna. Facilities Management and the Office of Sustainability work across campus to improve the livability of our landscapes. All 445 acres of the UT Dallas campus are managed in accordance with an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program that uses a four-tiered approach. By planting native plant species, UT Dallas saves irrigation water. As part of the Campus Landscape Enhancement Project, an Urban Forest (PDF) was established along University Drive. The forest is a densely planted area, reminiscent of a Texas creek bed. More than 5,000 trees and shrubs were planted, many of them native to Texas. The varieties include Afghan Pines, Bur Oaks, Caddo Maples, Cedar Elms, Chinquapin Oaks, Magnolias, Pond Cypress and Shumard Oaks. The Urban Forest is set in a natural riparian corridor running through campus. Through efficient and strategically planned watering, our Facilities Management team ensures that our campus landscape is healthy and visually appealing. Efficiency in campus irrigation minimizes water loss and waste. UT Dallas utilizes bioswales, rainwater harvesting, stormwater ponds, solar sync sensors, and native landscaping to minimize water loss and runoff.

Groundwater trends over the next 100 years will depend on the changes of water cycle under global warming. Professor Min-Hui Lo of NTU’s Department of Atmospheric Sciences and research teams from Europe, Asia, and North America have tried to discover light at the end of the tunnel. Their study “Divergent effects of climate change on future groundwater availability in key mid-latitude aquifers” was published in Nature Communications in July 2020. The study indicated that previous groundwater assessment had utilized regional hydrological models, but the researchers used a fully-coupled climate model, including the land, atmosphere, ice, and ocean components, to investigate GWS and water cycle changes over seven critical aquifers.

Professor Fi-John Chang of NTU’s Department of Bioenvironmental Systems Engineering worked with researchers from Tamkang University, Water Resources Agency, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. They used machine learning technology to predict flood patterns two days in advance. Their model can update the flood forecast synchronously with the actual rainfall to enhance accuracy. Due to the lack of reliable rainfall forecast in the past, prediction of hydrological conditions could only depend on actual rainfall, and it was difficult to make long-term predictions. With data of 97 typhoons between 1965 and 2015, the research team was able to acquire more accurate day-today predictions using AI technology. This technology enables them to make effective judgment and issue early warnings before typhoons arrive.

Pig farm biogas power production has been a common practice among white hog farms in Taiwan for many years; white hogs account for 90% of the pork market in Taiwan. Taoyuan Black Pigs are a native species in Taiwan. The black pig biogas plant in Taoyuan is the first biogas power plant using biogas from black pigs and the first biogas power plant in northern Taiwan. Methane in the biogas can be used for power generation, solid pig waste can be used as fertilizer, while the waste water can be purified and used for irrigation. Together, these approaches will minimize pig farms’ impact on the environment. The research team also tried mixing pig waste with such agricultural waste as rice stalks and vegetable leaves for anaerobic digestion to find out a ratio that would effectively produce methane and treat more waste water. The collaborative pig farm has about 5,000 pigs, and the biogas power plant produces 1,200 kWh of electricity per day. The biogas power plant reduces carbon emissions by 3,700 metric tons per year, eliminates sewage odors that used to annoy both the farmers and neighbors, and lessens farmers’ dependence on chemical fertilizers.

SDG 13 calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Anthropogenic global warming is now affecting every country on every continent, and 2019 was the second warmest year on record and the end of the warmest decade (2010- 2019) ever recorded. Global warming is leading to changes in weather patterns, rising sea levels and extreme weather events that all threaten to radically disrupt life on our planet. These impacts are already being experienced by vulnerable populations such as indigenous peoples, members of racial and ethnic minority groups, immigrants, the elderly and disabled people. This creates a situation of climate injustice. To meet the targets of SDG 13, the world must invest in sustainable and equitable solutions to transform its energy, industry, transport, agriculture and forestry systems to attempt to limit a rise in global temperatures, and promote climate adaptation, especially for disadvantaged populations and places.",The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) sets out the main points of the 13 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).,유엔기후변화협약(UNFCCC)은 13가지 지속가능발전목표(SDGs)의 요점을 제시합니다.,13,2

spending on female assignable goods is lower in

author then studies how rainfall shocks influence the
spending on female assignable goods by the
presence of a widow in the household. It is found that
although beneficial rainfall shocks increase overall
spending on female assignable goods, the increase is
lower in households with a widow. The results
highlight opposite findings for spending on male

Strategy for Infestations of
Japanese Knotweed
A recent study from NUI Galway, in
collaboration with AECOM and University of
Leeds, has found that the removal of moisture
could act as a potential control strategy for
smaller infestations of Japanese knotweed,
which are particularly common in urban
settings. Findings show that incorrect herbicide
treatment cannot control the growth and
regeneration of this invasive plant, but that fully
drying the plant material in a lab environment
allowed it to be returned to the soil without risk
of regrowth. The research also showed that if
there are no nodes attached to the rhizomes
there is no regeneration. Japanese knotweed
is a problematic invasive plant found in many
areas of Europe and North America. It can
grow up to two to three metres in height and
can dominate an area to the exclusion of most
other plants. Control of Japanese knotweed
is complicated by its ability to regenerate
from small fragments of plant material.",Removing moisture from the soil could help control the growth and regeneration of invasive plants., 토양에서 수분을 제거하면 침입 식물의 성장과 재생을 제어하는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다.,15,2
