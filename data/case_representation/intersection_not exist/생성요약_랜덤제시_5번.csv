3,남아프리카 공화국,Pretoria,"A systematic approach to partnering To address partnerships between UP and international partners, UP established both an International Cooperation Division (2003) and an office for International Strategic Partnerships (2019). UP’s Division for International Cooperation keeps a database of both current, expiring, and legacy partnerships and their nature. Also noted is the type of agreement (institutional, or by faculty name); the dates of the agreements; and comments about the nature of the agreement in terms of academic exchange, staff and student mobility. Every institution with whom UP would seek to enter an institutional agreement is categorised by country. This allows us to see the concentration of agreements and partnerships more easily. A background report is prepared on every single institution that UP, at any level, would seek to partner with. Types of information that the report contains typically include: • Collaboration by co-authored publications (according to Scival), per: - UP researcher author/s, including number of co-authored publications, citations, citations per publication, and the authors at the partner university; and, - Subject area and number of publications. • A listing of research undertaken at the partner institution is conducted including research entities, key themes and focus areas, as well as lists of centres, institutes, and focus groups. • Each report contains an overview of the partner institution. These reports take the self-awareness of the institution into context, before connecting the dots of all the resources potentially available to address complex challenges. By using a contextual approach, we understand the complex interplays between us, our partners, and the challenges we seek to address through the partnership.",The University of Pennsylvania (UP) has a long tradition of partnering with international institutions., University of Pennsylvania(UP)는 국제 기관과 협력하는 오랜 전통을 가지고 있습니다.,17,5

The process that ISP follows is encapsulated in the Africa-Global University Project (AGUP) strategy, a nested strategy for the achievement of UP’s Strategic Plan—2025. This was approved by the University’s Executive in November 2020. AGUP is a transformative initiative that seeks to reimagine UP’s approach to collective partnerships, and prioritises building an institution that is firmly focused on internationally recognised and high-quality scholarship while contributing to thoughtful development in South Africa, Africa and globally. This approach to inclusive partnerships with multiple stakeholders and networks within and beyond universities, and across continents, is critical because the multiplicity of current local and global challenges is complicated, intersectoral, and require transdisciplinary co-production of knowledge and co-innovation of solutions. In this way we can be relevant and truly responsive to the current and future challenges facing society. In 2020, the University signed 35 new agreements between universities from Brazil, Japan, Russia, Canada, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Tanzania, USA, Australia, Ecuador, and the Netherlands.

To raise standards of medical education globally and encourage more clinicians to build careers within the healthcare systems

in the UCL Medical School
are collaborating with medical educators to support teaching programmes around the world.
“We are working with partner institutions across the globe
to adapt elements of UCL’s internationally recognised medical programmes and tailor them to make them relevant to different local cultural, ethical and regulatory contexts,” explains Dr Ahmed Rashid, who leads the UCL Medical School Education Consultancy Unit.
In one partnership, UCL academics worked with colleagues at
New Giza University, Egypt, to devise modern and innovative undergraduate medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy programmes, to
be taught in Egypt. They used established materials, assessments and processes from the equivalent programmes at UCL as the programme’s basis, and adapted them to Egyptian sociocultural, ethical, professional and regulatory frameworks. Dr Rashid’s research with students and educators in
partner institutions has identified challenges such as language barriers and differing sociocultural traditions, which have been overcome by working with local education leaders to develop personalised programmes that fit the local context.
“These adaptations help to
ensure graduates develop a
sense of social responsibility and an understanding of local health challenges, making it more likely that they will stay in the healthcare system in their home country, where they are needed most,” explains Dr Rashid.","To raise standards of medical education globally and encourage more clinicians to build careers within the healthcare systems in their home countries, staff in the UCL Medical School are collaborating with medical educators to support teaching programmes around the world.", 전 세계적으로 의학 교육의 표준을 높이고 더 많은 임상의가 본국의 의료 시스템 내에서 경력을 쌓도록 장려하기 위해 UCL 의과 대학의 직원은 의료 교육자와 협력하여 전 세계의 교육 프로그램을 지원하고 있습니다.,17,5

To ensure that investment in science, technology and innovation (STI) is aligned to the SDGs the STRINGS project, led by Professor Joanna Chataway (UCL Science, Technology, Engineering & Public Policy, STEaPP) and colleagues
at the University of Sussex, is mapping the synergies, competing priorities and trade-offs between STI and the SDGs at local, national and global levels, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
“To mobilise science, technology, engineering and policy expertise to help change the world for the better, we must include communities in the research and innovation process at a local level, and steer investments to help ensure the most effective outcomes are achieved for the people most affected,” she explains.
Professor Chataway is also collaborating with the UN Development Programme and a consortium of five other universities and research centres in Argentina, India and South Africa.
The project is creating a worldwide map of the key areas of research and innovation that relate to the SDGs, both now and in the future. The consortium is also looking in depth at specific examples across the world to see where there is alignment (and misalignment) with the SDGs, with a view to applying any lessons learned elsewhere. In India, a STRINGS review of research into rice identified clusters of research on plant protection, crop yields, use of fertilisers
and socio-economic issues. Yet research focused on improving the nutritional value of rice is lacking.

“While governments, large organisations and big business inevitably have key roles to play in this, we believe that the most critical contributions will come from the growing number of small, fast- moving, innovative organisations that are springing up all over the world.”
To harness and maximise these contributions, in 2015 Professor Moore established Fast Forward 2030, a network of London-based entrepreneurs hosted by UCL IGP. “We need to inspire the next generation of leaders who, by 2030, will be the shapers of institutions, directors of businesses, producers of knowledge and inventors of technology,” says Professor Moore. “They will be key to achieving the Goals.”
Professor Moore launched Fast Forward 2030 in partnership with one such entrepreneur, UCL alumnus Arthur Kay (Bartlett School 2013), Chief Executive of bio-bean, a biofuel and biochemical company that recycles waste coffee grounds. Arthur co-founded bio-bean in 2013 while a student at UCL, with support from UCL Innovation & Enterprise.

Jarrod McPherson, along with Karl Pomorin from
KarlTek Pty Ltd, were in Laos at the Xayaburi River
hydropower project, to undertake their first major
field trip, which involved running intensive training
44 Sustainable Development Goals Report
workshops. While there, they were joined by Dr Alan
Temple from the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
“It was very much about upskilling our project
partners so that they can run things when we are
not on site,” says Lee.
Between the four, they ran training workshops on
electrofishing and PIT tagging, they tagged and
released some fish into the Mekong River, and
began tag retention trials at a fish research centre
that has been constructed at the site.
“We were over there with 20 people – a
combination of Xayaburi employees and Lao
government officials,” says Lee. “It was a very
intensive week. It was all about giving them the
practical skills they need for this project.”
In November, the outreach of this work was
extended even further when the Charles Sturt
project team partnered with the Crawford Fund
and converted the training into a series of publicly
available online instructional videos accessible
via the Crawford Fund YouTube site. There are
further plans to have these translated into multiple
languages to improve their accessibility.

encompasses three areas that are central to the missions of hig her education; Research and
Education; Practice and Infrastructure; Global and Community Engagement. Their current
initiatives were created at the intersection of the pillars: Sustainable Campus Forum,
Campus Farming/Composting, and learning from others and sharing. At the Sustainable
Campus Forum, they invite students, faculty members, and staff to discuss what makes a
campus sustainable by sharing different perspectives, empowering students to participate
in sustainability initiatives, decision-making within the University, and raising awareness of
global problems to take action on campus. The Campus Farming/ Composting that started
in 2015 continuously teaches how to enjoy harvesting organic vegetables, fruits, and
flowers, and appreciate the importance and difficulty of growing food. The organization’s
goal is to establish a cycle of recycling resources within the Yotsuya Campus by reusing
some of the food waste from dining halls and fallen leaves throughout the campus as
compost fertilizer for the farm’s soil. They also engage in empirical and theoretical research
by field-based learning and research, readings on sustainability, political ecology and
development, as well as farm visits. Those exchanges are transformed into journal articles,
seminars, workshops, discussion sessions, blog articles, and SNS posts to be shared with
others. KASA Sustainability invites everyone to join in making the campus more sustainable
by sharing experiences and learning to be sustainable beings! Everyone is welcome!
