Legal problems and ill-health often coincide. Without intervention, problems can escalate – with deteriorating health leading to financial difficulties, worsening living conditions and further stress and anxiety.
In 2016, the UCL Centre for Access to Justice established an integrated legal advice clinic, which provides free and legally aided advice to the local community in Stratford, East London, close to the university’s new UCL East campus on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
“Often the people who need legal help most are unsure of their rights and can ill-afford the advice they need,” explains Rachel Knowles (UCL Laws), the centre’s Head of Legal Practice and a practising solicitor. At the clinic, UCL Laws students, with supervision from qualified lawyers, provide free legal advice on a range of social welfare issues to the local community. In the seven years since the clinic was established, almost 200 UCL Law students have supported more than 500 people with legal advice and casework.
Among the people the clinic has helped are a woman struggling to obtain a disabled parking permit to support her son with autism, and a local resident who was left without accommodation and had to appeal to the courts to access housing benefit.","University College London’s (UCL) Centre for Access to Justice has established an integrated legal advice clinic, which provides free and legally aided advice to the local community in Stratford, East London, close to the university’s new UCL East campus on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.", 유니버시티 칼리지 런던(UCL)의 정의 접근 센터(Center for Access to Justice)는 퀸 엘리자베스 올림픽 공원(Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park)에 있는 대학의 새로운 UCL 이스트 캠퍼스와 가까운 이스트 런던(East London) 스트랫퍼드(Stratford)의 지역 사회에 무료 법률 자문을 제공하는 통합 법률 자문 클리닉을 설립했습니다.,16,4

In 2020, Professor Alberto Posso from the RMIT School of
Economics, Finance and Marketing collaborated with two
researchers from the Australian Catholic University (ACU)
to produce a strategic review of child sex abuse prevention
strategies in developing countries. This study was the first
of its kind as a review of such practices in countries with
limited state resources and funding had never been completed
before. Previous studies had only focused on developed
countries, especially anglophone countries. The published
paper, ‘Preventing child sexual abuse: A systemic review of
interventions and their efficacy in developing countries’, identified
which prevention strategies are used most often in developing
countries, and identified their real impact on preventing child
sex abuse.
Through this systemic review, the researchers discovered that
prevention programs in developing countries focus too narrowly
on school settings, and need to be extended outward to serve
and benefit the broader population. Recommendations included
government-led or community-driven prevention strategies,
which target the broader general population and therefore
empower participants with knowledge and skills to prevent child
sexual abuse. This knowledge can help inform future policy and
help extend justice beyond a select group of people to the wider
community. As many child sexual abuse reduction strategies
require systemic effort and change, research like this plays a
vital role in institutional reform and accompanying cultural shifts.","The RMIT School of Economics, Finance and Marketing collaborated with two researchers from the Australian Catholic University (ACU) to produce a strategic review of child sex abuse prevention strategies in developing countries."," RMIT 경제, 금융 및 마케팅 학교는 호주 가톨릭 대학교(ACU)의 두 연구원과 협력하여 개발 도상국의 아동 성 학대 예방 전략에 대한 전략적 검토를 작성했습니다.",16,4

Aboriginal people
Routine criminal record checks by employers are a major
hurdle for people with a criminal history – even if the history
is old, minor or irrelevant – who are aiming to contribute to
society through employment. Criminal record checking can
be a particularly significant barrier to employment in Aboriginal
communities, irrespective of the relevance of the criminal history.
The Victorian Legal Services Board has funded ‘Reducing
barriers to employment for Aboriginal people: rethinking
the role of criminal record checks’. This project explores ways
to improve employment opportunities for Aboriginal people and
to support employers in the recruitment of Aboriginal people.
It aims to identify existing good practice amongst employers and
to communicate these practices to jobseekers with a criminal
history, and to employers, including government agencies
and Aboriginal-run organisations, in ways that can be readily
adopted.
The project is a partnership between RMIT researchers at the
Centre for Innovative Justice, and Aboriginal organisations
Woor-Dungin, Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled
Health Organisations (VACCHO) and Winda Mara Aboriginal
Corporation. It builds on a previous partnership between RMIT
and Woor-Dungin, the Criminal Record Discrimination Project.
This project advocated for legal change in the accessibility of
criminal records, and in challenging the historical registering of
children taken into care as a criminal record. Advocacy through
this project led to legislation for the expungement of the criminal
records of children taken into care, including members of the
Stolen Generation, being passed in 2018, and the Victorian

under-examined in Australia is adolescent violence in the home
(AVITH). In 2020, the RMIT CIJ partnered with the Centre for
Family Research and Evaluation at Drummond Street Services
to investigate AVITH during COVID-19 lockdowns in
Australia and the United Kingdom. The research focused on
determining what the impact of lockdowns had been on AVITH,
how this compounds pre-existing disadvantage, and what policy
responses are needed to help achieve a decrease in AVITH.
A paper published in November 2020, found that specific
factors contributed to a rise in AVITH, including stress from
remote learning, lack of access to school and community
environments, and forced confinement with family.
The report then focused on what policy responses are needed
in a post-COVID world to rebuild from the damage of almost
six months of lockdown, and the impact it has had on AVITH.
These include focusing public money into community services,
focusing again on reform to the justice system, and building
in a “safeguard surge” to community services, whereby
services are equipped to deal with a surge in demandfollowing
deconfinement. These findings will help inform policy responses
to the specific issue of AVITH, and can also be applied to
wider social issues and community support services.
These findings support not only the prevention of
violence, but also facilitate positive structural reform
in the justice system.",The Centre for Injury and Justice (CIJ) at the Royal Melbourne University (RMU) has produced a series of papers on a range of topics., Royal Melbourne University(RMU)의 Center for Injury and Justice(CIJ)는 다양한 주제에 대한 일련의 논문을 제작했습니다.,16,4

safe and from what?
An inconsistent approach to how ‘child safety’

elements that achieve these aims, argues a
2020 paper co-authored by Charles Sturt’s Dr
Donnah Anderson from the School of Psychology.
The article, published in the journal Social
Policy and Administration, found that two main
constructions of children were evident in the
394 policy documents analysed – one that sees
children as vulnerable and needing protection, and
another as social actors with agency, rights, and
capabilities. The paper found that the organisations
primarily evaluating their ‘child safe’ status by
compliance-based agendas that protect institutions

181,일본,Sophia,"Without peace, stability, human rights and effective governance, based on the rule of law - we
cannot hope for sustainable development. We are living in a world that is increasingly divided. Some
regions enjoy sustained levels of peace, security and prosperity, while others fall into seemingly
endless cycles of conflict and violence. This is by no means inevitable and must be addressed.
High levels of armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country’s development,
affecting economic growth and often resulting in long standing grievances that can last for
generations. Sexual violence, crime, exploitation and torture are also prevalent where there is
conflict or no rule of law, and countries must take measures to protect those who are most at risk.
Home to only 5 percent of the world’s population, the Arab region was home to almost 47 percent
of the world’s internally displaced population in 2014 and 57.5 percent of the world’s refugees.
Most of those were forcibly displaced because of conflict and violence, as the Arab region has
witnessed almost 18 percent of the world conflicts between 1948 and 2014, 45 percent of global
terrorist attacks in 2014, and 68 percent of the world’s battle-related deaths in the same year.
The value of the Human Development Index for Libya and Syria has dwindled to levels last seen
15 years ago. Other estimates suggest that Syria may have lost over 35 years of hard-won gains
in human development. The SDGs aim to significantly reduce all forms of violence, and work with
governments and communities to find lasting solutions to conflict and insecurity. Strengthening the
rule of law and promoting human rights is key to this process, as is reducing the flow of illicit arms
and strengthening the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance.

【Course description】
Peace studies is an “interdisciplinary research and education on the causes of
war and conditions of amity,” and what I personally refer to as peace studies is
conducted particularly from the standpoint of Christianity on the basis of God’s
creation and redemption.
The peace aimed at here is not just “negative peace,” which refers to a state
without warfare or discord, but also “positive peace,” which refers to a state
wherein structural violence such as poverty, oppression, and discrimination have
been eradicated. Structural violence is built into the social, cultural and economic
institutions. In the Bible, peace is signified by the Hebrew word “shalom,” which
is derived from the word meaning “complete,” and it represents peace in a
comprehensive sense. Shalom is a state of life that requires nothing, and it the
fulfillment of life in the existence of the living God, the love of human beings for
each other, and the fullness of life in the community of all cr eatures. It is something
completely intact. Consequently, the goal of peace studies broadly covers the
goals of the SDGs.
Here we will develop an ability to analyze the world situation, and we will develop
also a sensitivity towards concord, via the use of textbooks and audiovisual material.","The goal of this course is to develop an ability to analyze the world situation, and we will develop also a sensitivity towards concord, via the use of textbooks and audiovisual material."," 본 교과목의 목표는 세계정세를 분석하는 능력을 기르는 것이며, 교과서와 시청각자료를 활용하여 화합에 대한 감수성을 함양하는 것이다.",16,4

After the initial presentations by three prominent UN officials, Professor Kurimoto
shared his 40 years’ experiences of his field research on South Sudan, and presented
his argument about the need of understanding traditional conflict resolution mechanism
(TCRM) to have better approaches for peacebuilding efforts in South Sudan.
Professor Higashi shared his experience in Afghanistan as a team leader for
reconciliation and reintegration in UNAMA (UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan), as
well as his field research as a professor in South Sudan to argue why understanding
TCRM is critical for peacebuilding. He then shared his recommendations about how
UN field mission could utilize the knowledge of the experts on TCRM.
After the presentations by five panelists, a moderator and panelists exchanged
their views and arguments on this critical issue. They concluded the discussion by
confirming the importance of strengthening TCRM in the context of post-conflict
peacebuilding efforts.

At UT Dallas, we make an active effort to ensure all eligible voters on campus are educated about upcoming elections and have the opportunity to vote. This is accomplished in several ways. The Office of the President sends out emails to the entire UT Dallas community for upcoming major elections, with information about voting on and near campus. UT Dallas Student Government has also improved voting accessibility on campus by establishing polling centers on campus. In the November 2020 election, UTD was home to polling centers for both Dallas and Collin County. Student Government further incentivized students to exercise their civic duty by hosting the Party at the Polls event, offering pizza and fun activities to draw students to polling locations. Texas Rising, an on-campus student organization, also hosts voter registration drives on campus throughout the year with registered student VDRs.

Landmines can lie dormant for decades. Hidden in the ground, they are triggered by pressure and kill peacekeepers, aid workers and children. For recovering countries, their safe detection and removal is just one of the complex issues they face. However their detection is not easy. Typically the process uses ground-penetrating radar to detect reflected signals, but changes in soil density in addition to submerged items such as plant roots or rocks can also cause false alarms. This makes detection a time-consuming, costly and dangerous process. Mathematicians in UEA’s Clean Sweep project have been developing algorithms to make clearing minefields safer. Their new image ‘stacking’ method reduces the effect of ground conditions, minimising the uncertainly in landmine localisation.
