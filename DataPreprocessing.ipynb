All initiatives focus on addressing racial and gender disparities along with building capability. Through our Department of Research and Innovation, UP is foregrounding programmes in support of early-career academics and researchers, underpinned by mentorship that accelerates the time-frame from early career to professor. The nGAP programme, which was introduced in 2016, provides funding of R2.5 million per academic post over six years. UP had filled 26 positions by 2020, comprising 18 women and eight men from designated (historically disadvantaged) categories. Thus far, 11 nGAP candidates have completed their PhDs; there have been four confirmed submissions during 2021; and the remainder are progressing according to plan. Other development initiatives include the Programme for Academic Leadership for senior academics offered by the University’s business school, the Gordon Institute of Business Science, the UP Executive Coaching Programme for newly appointed deans and directors, and the Management Development Programme, which prepares participants for the transition from managing a department or business unit to a more generalised and senior managerial function. Engagement with employees in bargaining units is governed by the recognition agreements we share with recognised labour unions. Union representatives negotiate of behalf of their members on issues such as annual salary increases or any changes to conditions of employment. An important aspect of decent work for all employees is remuneration, and the fairness thereof. This is guided by the University’s Remuneration Policy which enables fair and consistent application across individual employees and employee categories, while attracting and retaining talent to further the University’s strategic objectives. The policy considers internal and external parity, and the University supports the principles of fair and equitable remuneration, and equal pay for work of equal value.

The Colbyn Wetlands are also closely associated with the Hartebeestspruit riverine system. The Strubenkop outcrop is located on the University’s Hillcrest campus. Prior to the initiative, it was heavily infested with alien and/or invader weeds, shrubs and trees. Wide areas of this particularly difficult terrain have been cleared of alien and invader species, and rubble. Restoration has been undertaken by introducing and replanting original indigenous plant species, including grass, thereby creating the conditions required for ecological plant succession. Natural vegetation is returning, and animal and bird species are once again populating the area. The Hartebeestspruit is a typical urban riverine system, and subject to annual flooding. The water body flows south to north, along the western boundary of Hillcrest campus. The associated Colbyn Wetlands, which fall beyond the University’s boundary, constitute a sensitive ecosystem with unique flora, and play a role in filtering specific pollutants from waterways running downstream. With the rapidly changing urban environment upstream, the Hartebeestspruit Restoration Project focuses on strengthening resilience of the urban water channel. Activities include stabilisation of the embankment by means of a bio-engineering approach; civil engineering works to reintroduce the flood plains while being mindful of adjacent development, and to redirect water during flood surges; establishing plant filtration areas to filter toxic water from upstream; clearing alien invasive flora, in particular kikuyu grass infestations; and the establishment of indigenous and locally adapted plant species. Recuperation of the area is evident, with the return of bird life, insects, reptiles, and other animals alongside the recovering plant life. The restoration continues to be actively managed',\n",

Also noted is the type of agreement (institutional, or by faculty name); the dates of the agreements; and comments about the nature of the agreement in terms of academic exchange, staff and student mobility. Every institution with whom UP would seek to enter an institutional agreement is categorised by country. This allows us to see the concentration of agreements and partnerships more easily. A background report is prepared on every single institution that UP, at any level, would seek to partner with. Types of information that the report contains typically include: • Collaboration by co-authored publications (according to Scival), per: - UP researcher author/s, including number of co-authored publications, citations, citations per publication, and the authors at the partner university; and, - Subject area and number of publications. • A listing of research undertaken at the partner institution is conducted including research entities, key themes and focus areas, as well as lists of centres, institutes, and focus groups. • Each report contains an overview of the partner institution.

But existing models do not consider the impact on individual household’s ability to avoid financial hardship,” explains Dr Ralph Luetticke (UCL Economics). Depending on their financial outgoings, and whether they have savings or other assets, households vary greatly in their ability to withstand economic shocks, such as unemployment. Many have to rely on credit cards and loans. Dr Luetticke and his departmental colleague Professor Morten Ravn wanted to develop insights to allow a deeper understanding of financial regulation and its interaction with inequality.

The centre is a cross-disciplinary hub that brings together ecologists, computer scientists, city planners, economists and social scientists, to gather evidence on how natural resources can be best managed for a sustainable future. The centre has devised a novel smart sensor to monitor bat populations in the park. It captures high-frequency sounds, such as bat calls, and converts them into an image called a spectrogram. Computer algorithms built into the sensor then scan the images to identify the presence of different bat species by their calls. “Bat species are a good indicator of the general health of the natural environment in a particular area,” explains Professor Kate Jones (UCL Centre for Biodiversity & Environment Research), Director of the People and Nature Lab. “They are the top predator of nocturnal insects, so the impact of any changes in land use on the insect species has a knock-on impact on bats.”',\n",

Professor Chataway is also collaborating with the UN Development Programme and a consortium of five other universities and research centres in Argentina, India and South Africa. The project is creating a worldwide map of the key areas of research and innovation that relate to the SDGs, both now and in the future. The consortium is also looking in depth at specific examples across the world to see where there is alignment (and misalignment) with the SDGs, with a view to applying any lessons learned elsewhere. In India, a STRINGS review of research into rice identified clusters of research on plant protection, crop yields, use of fertilisers and socio-economic issues.

              " 'Taking partnering to the next level The Office for International Strategic Partnerships (ISP) aims to engage partners who would provide mutual benefit in attaining UP’s vision —“to be the leading African global university”—and goals, as set out in UP’s Strategic Plan—2025. The process that ISP follows is encapsulated in the Africa-Global University Project (AGUP) strategy, a nested strategy for the achievement of UP’s Strategic Plan—2025. This was approved by the University’s Executive in November 2020. AGUP is a transformative initiative that seeks to reimagine UP’s approach to collective partnerships, and prioritises building an institution that is firmly focused on internationally recognised and high-quality scholarship while contributing to thoughtful development in South Africa, Africa and globally. This approach to inclusive partnerships with multiple stakeholders and networks within and beyond universities, and across continents, is critical because the multiplicity of current local and global challenges is complicated, intersectoral, and require transdisciplinary co-production of knowledge and co-innovation of solutions. In this way we can be relevant and truly responsive to the current and future challenges facing society. In 2020, the University signed 35 new agreements between universities from Brazil, Japan, Russia, Canada, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Tanzania, USA, Australia, Ecuador, and the Netherlands. This was at both institutional and faculty level, and various agreements were addended with student and staff exchanges or for joint supervision.',\n",

It is also part of the UN’s Sustainable Development Solutions Network and the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation Global Partnership Initiative. Hosted within ALLI, the South African SDG Hub aggregates the best and most relevant South African research related to the SDGs. The strategic objectives of the hub include enabling access to relevant, useful, and reliable knowledge resources; providing policy advice; promoting dialogue; and building capacity. Its machinelearning-based classification tool automatically classifies research in terms of one or more SDGs, equipping leaders with the most relevant knowledge. This enables working with multilateral institutions, governments, and companies to accelerate the implementation of SDGs.',\n",

In 2020, the UKRI Global Challenges Research Fund awarded UP, the University of Leeds (UK), and the Food and Agriculture Research and Policy Analysis Network (FANRPAN), a R50 million grant to enhance research for sustainable food systems in Africa. This project takes an innovative and collaboration-based approach to supervising early-career research fellows with one supervisor from the University of Leeds, one from the home institution of the fellow, and a supervisor from UP. These research triads are a fundamental unit of collaboration-based transformation in the higher education space. It provides valuable and multiple perspectives, both local, continental, and internationally on research approaches. This speaks to development, as the project works across 10 from six developing countries: Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia. UP is a member of the African Research Universities Alliance (ARUA), an alliance of 16 research universities across 10 countries in Africa with diverse historical contexts, seeking to play a leading role in increasing the quality of research through collaboration and peer-learning models. The alliance acknowledges the fact that partnerships and networking have become essential to leverage resources for greater impact. ARUA makes use of the centres of excellence (CoEs) model to enhance research and capacitybuilding in researchers across the continent. Member universities host CoEs that operate on the principles of partnership, enhanced research, and capacity-building. The interdisciplinary working of the centres are shaped by the nature of the challenges they seek to address. They are focal points for world-class researchers undertaking cuttingedge research.

Remote sensing data obtained from drone and satellite imagery of the Heron Island Reef in Queensland has been used to better understand the huge volume of sediment passed through holothurians (sea cucumbers). Sea cucumbers are closely related to sea urchins and sea stars and spend their lives eating sediment, digesting the micro-organisms present, and pooping out ‘clean’ sediment, just like earthworms. This process, called ‘bioturbation’, plays an important role in coral reefs by aerating the sea floor, providing ‘fresh’ sediment, and releasing calcium carbonate into the water as a by-product to help support coral growth.',\n",

With the GAP, ETH Zurich focused on four areas of action: (1) careers and career development in the academic area, (2) integration of gender-specific aspects in research and teaching, (3) facilitation of work/life balance, and (4) preventing and combating sexual harassment and discrimination on the basis of gender. In 2020, the progress of the GAP was evaluated for the fourth time, with the 16 departments being invited to report on their (new) measures to implement the plan. Since the last evaluation in 2018, the implementation in the departments has further progressed. Many measures will continue to be implemented in a decentralised manner and tai- lored to the needs of the various departments. For the period from 2018 until 2020, it is notable that most departments focused their efforts on career development for women (direct professorial appointments, mentoring) and on supporting girls (initiatives for school-aged girls), along with founding and supporting female asso- ciations and gender and diversity groups. Only few measures focused on the work/ study/family balance or on sexual harassment.

              "'A network of innovation to deliver the SDGs “Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 will require a concerted effort from everybody on the planet,” says Professor Dame Henrietta Moore (UCL Institute for Global Prosperity, IGP). “While governments, large organisations and big business inevitably have key roles to play in this, we believe that the most critical contributions will come from the growing number of small, fast- moving, innovative organisations that are springing up all over the world.” To harness and maximise these contributions, in 2015 Professor Moore established Fast Forward 2030, a network of London-based entrepreneurs hosted by UCL IGP. “We need to inspire the next generation of leaders who, by 2030, will be the shapers of institutions, directors of businesses, producers of knowledge and inventors of technology,” says Professor Moore. “They will be key to achieving the Goals.” Professor Moore launched Fast Forward 2030 in partnership with one such entrepreneur, UCL alumnus Arthur Kay (Bartlett School 2013), Chief Executive of bio-bean, a biofuel and biochemical company that recycles waste coffee grounds. Arthur co-founded bio-bean in 2013 while a student at UCL, with support from UCL Innovation & Enterprise. Through its research, website and workshops, Fast Forward 2030 provides space for policymakers, entrepreneurs and citizens to share and collaborate on new projects and solutions to ecological and social problems. Following the success of the London hub, Fast Forward has gone on to launch networks in Lebanon and Kenya.'"

            "HKU believes climate change is a global issue that requires collaboration between experts and stakeholders from across the world. For this reason, the University actively works with other universities and advocacy groups and engages the public to tackle climate change together. Since climate is often impacted by urban living and design, the Faculty of Architecture’s HK Urban Lab has brought climate concerns to the table among its network through Sustainable HD Cities Labs. In 2017, the Urban Heat Symposium was held to bring together researchers, academics, industry and government leaders to discuss and seek solutions regarding the relationship between a high-density city like Hong Kong, heatwave events and urban island heat effects. Similar events on climate change have also been held in relation to ocean acidification (Interdisciplinary Symposium on Ocean Acidification and Climate Change (ISOACC)), marine pollution (The 8th International Conference on Marine Pollution and Ecotoxicology (ICMPE-8)), and water resilience (Water Forum 2017: Climate Change Resilience – Sponge City).\n",
            "HKU는 기후 변화가 전 세계의 전문가와 이해 관계자 간의 협력이 필요한 글로벌 문제라고 생각합니다. 이러한 이유로, 대학은 다른 대학 및 옹호 단체와 적극적으로 협력하고 기후 변화를 함께 해결하기 위해 대중을 참여시킵니다. 기후는 종종 도시 생활과 디자인에 의해 영향을 받기 때문에 건축 학부의 HK Urban Lab은 지속 가능한 HD 도시 실험실을 통해 기후 문제를 네트워크 중에서 테이블에 가져 왔습니다. 2017 년에 Urban Heat Symposium은 연구원, 학계, 산업 및 정부 지도자들이 모여 홍콩, 열파 이벤트 및 Urban Island Heat Effect와 같은 고밀도 도시의 관계에 관한 솔루션을 논의하고 추구하기 위해 열렸습니다. 해양 산성화 (해양 산성화 및 기후 변화에 관한 학제 간 심포지엄 (ISOACC)), 해양 오염 (해양 오염 및 생태 독성학에 관한 제 8 차 국제 회의 및 수자원 회의)과 관련하여 기후 변화에 대한 유사한 사건이 열렸습니다.

Or that over 3 billion people rely on coastal and marine biodiversity?   Understand land actions affect water and vice versa. Help eliminate waste onshore as most litter in the water comes from land.  Inform yourself on the importance of oceans and marine life by watching documentaries. Chasing Coral Start regularly volunteering for community cleanups and pick up litter around you.  Avoid single use plastic and overpackaged products. Shop and eat local, paying attention to those that use regenerative sustainable practices. Look for labels when buying fish that state it was caught sustainably.  Become or encourage local fisheries to receive a sustainable license. Stop buying jewelry or other items from material made of shells, coral, or other marine life. Research, engage, and support organizations that protect the oceans. Avoid buying wild saltwater fish for aquariums. Advocate and engage in responsible recreational activities like boating, fishing, snorkelling, and kayaking. Respect conservation areas and laws related to overfishing. Look into programs offered to help protect and increase biodiversity. \n",
